_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.48-dev2 (23 October 2026)._

## Status: 23 October 2026

Open. Found by a mapping spot-check of the [NPC voice table](../NPC_VOICE_TABLE.md).

## Symptom

Two NPC records, atúlg gro-largúm and yatúr gro-shak, have accented letters in their record ids. The voice table
builder leaves them out on purpose, so these two never greet or bark. The other 2,673 NPC records are in the table.

## How it was found

The table was built from the full game data, read back, and checked NPC by NPC. Each one gets the voice of its own
race and sex, for example:
- Fargoth: Wood Elf male;
- Caius Cosades: Imperial male;
- Habasi and Ajira: Khajiit female;
- the census officer: Breton male, with his own "What do you think you're doing?!" thief line;
- the census captain: his own recorded "Your papers, please.".

The table's own report then lists the two left-out records, both with the reason "non-ASCII record id".

## Fix

Key the table's id strings in Windows-1252, the game data's own encoding, and look ids up in the engine with the
same bytes. Then drop the skip in `plan_npcs`.

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Actors and NPCs (`actors-npc`). Actor placement, models and behaviour; the actor placement gate. See [families](README.md#families).

- ACTOR-ANNOTATE-ROOM-REFERENCE-48 (no report page): The image step stopped on a room corpse: its actor annotation looked up the support class by id alone, but room actors are classified by reference
- [ACTOR-BAKE-CENTRE-SEAM-48](ACTOR-BAKE-CENTRE-SEAM-48.md): Bradil Elarven (Glassworker's Hall) left unbaked: his centre probe falls through the seam of two floor pieces
- ACTOR-GROUND-BAKE-CHIM-ROOMS-48 (no report page): The image step stopped in the actor ground bake: it loaded the batch-room shell maps as classic collision scenes, and its error named no map
- [ACTOR-SPAWN-DROPTOFLOOR-49](ACTOR-SPAWN-DROPTOFLOOR-49.md): The resident spawn grounding as Quake's droptofloor, one rule with the build's room bake
- ACTOR-STATE-NOT-READ-ON-SPAWN-54 (no report page): A spawned actor never reads its actor record back: a killed NPC respawns alive and lowered health resets on re-entry or load
- ACTOR-STATE-POOL-LIMITS-54 (no report page): The actor record drops changes past 128 changed actors, 12 item changes or 8 spell changes per actor; package changes of the behaviour records and NPC positions are not saved
- ACTOR-STORM-POSE-51 (no report page): Requested: characters shield their eyes in ash and blight storms (the idlestorm pose), as all regular NPCs and the player do in the original, often seen in Ald'ruhn
- ACTOR-WANDER-AGGRO-52 (no report page): Requested: NPCs and creatures wander, idle and aggro by their own record variables (AI packages, Fight), as the original game does
- AMBIENT-RESIDENTS-NOT-VISIBLE-54 (no report page): From the matched pose OpenMW shows four residents on the Seyda Neen square, AmiWind one far figure
- AMBIENT-WALK-STUCK-COLLISION-54 (no report page): Eight of 15 resident walks in the Seyda Neen MiniWind ended stuck: the step trace against the CHIM frame collision blocks most routes
- [ANIMKIT-ACTOR-ABI-SITES-35](ANIMKIT-ACTOR-ABI-SITES-35.md): With the animation kit on, the image step stopped late, one tool at a time, on actor models with more than the previous 8 or 21 frames (guard torch companions last)
- [ANIMKIT-COVERAGE-35](ANIMKIT-COVERAGE-35.md): NPCs that move or fight have no walk, run or attack animation: Fargoth and other Seyda Neen villagers glitch toward the player
- [ANIMKIT-GROUND-CHECK-LAYOUT-35](ANIMKIT-GROUND-CHECK-LAYOUT-35.md): With the animation kit on, every image step stopped: the actor ground check refused resident models with more than 8 frames
- [ANIMKIT-IMAGE-FORMATS-35](ANIMKIT-IMAGE-FORMATS-35.md): With the animation kit on, the image step stopped late on the kit's layout files: their format was unknown to the palette overlay
- [ANIMKIT-ITEM-TAG-FRAMES-35](ANIMKIT-ITEM-TAG-FRAMES-35.md): With the animation kit on, residents fought without their weapon and shield: the item tag tables had one row per kit sample, not per model frame, and the mover model had none
- AW-20260928-05 (no report page): Dock guard misses approach interception
- AW-20260929-01 (no report page): Player passes through town NPCs
- AW25-10 (no report page): Actor-contact failures stopped image assembly only after terrain
- [CAMERA-POV-TAP-LOST-36](CAMERA-POV-TAP-LOST-36.md): A Toggle POV (Tab) tap released before the next frame did not switch the view
- [CAMERA-THIRDPERSON-COMBAT-NPC-HIDDEN-36](CAMERA-THIRDPERSON-COMBAT-NPC-HIDDEN-36.md): In combat, switching to third person (Tab) hides the NPC you are fighting; it reappears back in first person
- [CHIM-ACTOR-GROUNDING-POLICY-36](CHIM-ACTOR-GROUNDING-POLICY-36.md): A CHIM area outside the shipped towns stops at its chim-town stage: the NPC grounding policy lists only the shipped towns' NPCs, and the check runs 40 minutes into the build
- CHIM-ACTOR-TABLE-BEFORE-FRAME-MAPS-48 (no report page): The CHIM actor table was written before any frame map existed, so even town residents in it carry no frame-map position (built_rows_used 0)
- [COMBAT-RUN-ROOT-DRIFT-33](COMBAT-RUN-ROOT-DRIFT-33.md): Arena fighters' run frames carry the root's forward motion: the body slides ahead and snaps back each cycle
- [COMPANION-NO-RUN-ANIM-33](COMPANION-NO-RUN-ANIM-33.md): The companion slides instead of walking or running, and mimic mode does not mirror the gait
- [CREATURE-BAKE-NIF-UNSUPPORTED-47](CREATURE-BAKE-NIF-UNSUPPORTED-47.md): The creature bake refuses 14 of the 39 creature meshes the outdoor world can show, the cliff racer, the rat, the guar and the nix-hound among them

- [CREATURE-DAGOTH-UR-ABSENT-52](CREATURE-DAGOTH-UR-ABSENT-52.md): Dagoth Ur and the Heart of Lorkhan are not in their rooms: the room creature list never named them, so Akulakhan s Chamber has neither
- CREATURE-SCALE-KEYS-54 (no report page): The Heart of Lorkhan beats by a scale key, and the skeletal animation table format holds no scale
- DANCER-OWN-ANIM-IGNORED-53 (no report page): The Suran dancers only idle: an NPC's own animation file (anim_dancingGirl.nif) was ignored by the skeletal actors
- HAIR-CHECK-ACTOR-GROUND-1999-54 (no report page): The actor ground check still refused skeletal models past 1,999 vertices

- HELD-MODEL-GAPS-54 (no report page): 17 of 65 shields have no held model
- [INTERIOR-CREATURES-MISSING-41](INTERIOR-CREATURES-MISSING-41.md): No creature is placed in any interior: the resident stage takes NPC records only, so the demigod Vivec is missing from his palace

- [NPC-FEMALE-SKELETON-33](NPC-FEMALE-SKELETON-33.md): Female humans are posed on the male skeleton file (base_anim.nif), the original uses base_anim_female.nif
- [NPC-FOLLOW-FLOORS-33](NPC-FOLLOW-FLOORS-33.md): The test companion cannot find stairs to another floor of an interior; it is placed beside the player after 6 seconds
- [NPC-GREETINGS-LIBRARY-MUTE-48](NPC-GREETINGS-LIBRARY-MUTE-48.md): NPCs placed by the actor library had no greeting, and every NPC said only part of its voice vocabulary

- [NPC-HEAD-DECIMATION-33](NPC-HEAD-DECIMATION-33.md): NPC heads decimated into unrecognisable faces

- [NPC-SPEAR-ATTACK-REGRESSION-39](NPC-SPEAR-ATTACK-REGRESSION-39.md): Seyda Neen guard spear attack animation is missing in first-person view

- [RESIDENT-ANIM-BYTE-BUDGET-48](RESIDENT-ANIM-BYTE-BUDGET-48.md): A room resident whose animation kit model is over the alias byte budget at every rung stopped the whole room stage (ienas nadus)

- SKEL-GROUP-SPAN-52 (no report page): The beast table s spellcast group spanned 200 seconds of other animations: a phased group was cut from its first key to its last
- SKEL-ITEM-TAGS-52 (no report page): Skeletal actors draw no carried weapon, shield or torch: the item tags hold one row per model frame, and a skeletal model has every table frame
- SKEL-READERS-BLOCK-52 (no report page): The builder s readers of actor models refused or misjudged a skeletal model: the ground check stopped the build, the stream estimate called it unstreamable
- SKEL-TABLE-VIVEC-LAYERED-54 (no report page): Vivec's animation table is layered over the whole humanoid base table: 141 groups, 684 KB
- SKEL-VERTEX-LIMIT-52 (no report page): A skeletal actor with the full-detail head (about 3,000 vertices) cannot be read: the skeletal block is read only by the alias stream, which takes at most 2,000 vertices
