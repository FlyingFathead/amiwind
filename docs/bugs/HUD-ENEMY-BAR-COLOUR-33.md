## Status: 9 October 2026

Repaired in source on v0.0.33-arena-combat (project decision: yellow in the reserved UI palette),
not yet in a build. Seen in the first Vivec Arena run in the emulator (docs/COMBAT.md).

## Symptom

The enemy's health bar appears above the player's health bar at the right size and time, but in an
orange close to the health bar's red instead of the original's yellow.

## Where

`tools/prepare_ui.py` builds the bar from the original grey bar tinted (1, 0.729, 0) into `gfx/ui.awu`
and quantizes it to the image palette; the reserved UI palette bank (`tools/ui_palette.py`) holds the
red, blue and green bar colours only.

## How it happened

The palette was kept unchanged on purpose: the reserved bank is shared with the hand catalogues,
which must match it byte for byte.

## Why it was not caught

The host tests check the bar's place and timing, not its colours after quantization.

## Reproduction

Always: `dbgmode arenapit`, punch at the opponent, look at the bar above the health bar.

## Repair

`tools/ui_palette.py`: the reserved bank (format 2) is quantized from the red, blue, green and the
yellow bar (`yellow_bar`, one implementation shared with the UI atlas in `tools/prepare_ui.py`); a scene
with a format 1 bank is upgraded in place. The hand catalogue follows the reserved palette as before
(`prepare_hand_catalog.runtime_palette`). The sky palette approval (`sky_palette_overlay.approved`) checks
the approved fingerprint with the format 1 bank put back (`ui_palette.legacy_bank`, from the owned bars),
so the sky bank and the world colours are unchanged; only indices 225..253 differ.

## Verification

`tests/test_ui_palette.py` EnemyBarYellow: the tint, the bank-independent sky approval (a change outside
the bank is refused) and the in-place upgrade. In the emulator (the Vivec Arena, private evidence image)
the bar shows amber-yellow after, orange before, at the same place.

## Prevention

UI colours added later get a palette check (distance of the quantized colour to the intended one).
