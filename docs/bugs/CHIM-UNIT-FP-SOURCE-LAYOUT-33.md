## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed in source, not yet in a numbered build; store-once conversion. Found by CHIMport (docs/chim/CHIMPORT.md) while reading its mesh reuse curve.

## Symptom

CHIMport converts each exterior cell through its own source stage, and all cells share one unit cache. The
cache should convert every mesh once, but rings 1 to 4 built 9,526 mesh units for 1,081 distinct meshes:
about 8.8 times the work. 481 of 729 meshes sampled have a different scenery index record from one cell to
the next.

## Where

`tools/chim/build.py`, `mesh_fingerprint`: it fingerprints the scenery index model record as a whole,
including its archive `offset`, the collision `offset`, the `textures` list and each material's
`texture_index`. Those are positions in that stage's own archive and texture list, not content.

## How it happened

Until CHIMport, every CHIM build had one source stage per town, so the same mesh rarely met the cache
from two different source stages.

## Why it was not caught

The unit cache tests reuse units within one source stage.

## Reproduction

Always: build two neighbouring cells that place the same mesh with different neighbours (their scenery
archives and texture lists differ); the second build converts the mesh again.

## Repair

Fixed in source on the CHIM builder line (f253923): mesh, variant and texture unit keys come from content
hashes and settings, with texture indices mapped back per source stage; the written world is unchanged
(the Vivec Arena world rebuilt byte for byte, 18 of 18 files).

## Verification

CHIMport after the fix (one full re-key of the cache first): 319 cells wrote 1,156 mesh units for 977
distinct meshes (1.18 times; the rest are flora and collision-only variants of the same meshes), against
9,526 units for 1,081 meshes before (8.8 times). Per ring, units converted against new distinct meshes:
ring 5 3,944 / 123 (old keys), ring 7 200 / 20 and ring 8 80 / 34 (the re-key tail), ring 9 48 / 32.

## Prevention

CHIMport records mesh units built per cell next to the census' distinct meshes per ring, so a gap shows in
every run.
