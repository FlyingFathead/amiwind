## Symptom

The v0.0.38 full image stopped during its content fingerprint with a missing
`maps/vf0302.bsp`, after all 2,508 stair-map checks and the map heap gate passed.

## Where

`tools/build_aga.py`, `write_content_fingerprint`: the world-region map list.

## How it happened

The payload pruning step correctly removed 135 exterior BSP maps whose entire
cores are owned by higher-priority town routes. Their directory indices remain
stable for routing. The fingerprint respected declared removals in town maps
and harvest catalogues but rebuilt the world-map list without that filter.

## Why it was not caught

The pruning regression checked retained maps and matching harvest catalogues,
but did not execute the complete save fingerprint after pruning. The full
image caught the missing integration case before HDF creation.

## Reproduction

Prune a world directory containing a fully town-owned map, retain its routing
row, and run the real content fingerprint with the declared removal list.
Before repair it attempts to hash the removed BSP and raises FileNotFoundError.

## Repair

Apply the existing explicit removal list to resolved world-map paths as well.
Retained BSP and CHIM maps still participate in the save namespace. Undeclared
missing maps remain fatal. This is an offline image-builder correction; the
runtime engine and its map-routing mechanism are unchanged.

## Verification

Source correction after the full-image failure at eff90ee passes 25 focused
payload, fingerprint and world-asset tests. A combined
prune-and-fingerprint regression also changes a retained map to check that its
bytes still affect the fingerprint, and removes an undeclared map to require
failure. Corrected full-image readback and native routing remain pending.

## Prevention

Exercise pruning through the actual content fingerprint, alongside its
catalogue validation. Keep stable directory rows distinct from packaged files.

## Never-compiled exterior handoff, 13 October 2026

The dev1 prebuild checklist also prevents fully town-owned BSPs from being
compiled at all. Such files never enter the pruning removal list. The image
fingerprint now takes their omissions from the terrain receipt and verifies
the embedded checklist, current town cores, unchanged routing rows and actual
CHIM town frame maps. An unexpected compiled map, unused catalogue, missing
CHIM owner or changed assignment fails instead of triggering a BSP fallback.

The integrated regression starts with no superseded map file, passes the real
fingerprint through the same omission helper used by image assembly, and
checks that changing the CHIM maintainer changes the fingerprint. A further integration check follows the actual image CLI: the prebuild planner passes --exterior-terrain independently of the optional refined-terrain installer. All 65 focused checks pass. It also rejects
an undeclared omission, duplicate BSP, unused catalogue and missing CHIM maintainer.
Complete image and native acceptance remain pending.

## Exact RC1 evidence, 13 October 2026

The exact RC1 image and independently extracted package contain 360 verified
whole regional cells, including Tel Uvirith (10,1). Six selected cells
(-3,-11), (-2,-11), (-1,-11), (0,-11), (5,-14) and (6,-14) overlap packaged
town frames only partially and are excluded from that whole-cell count.
All 9,360 frame/chunk files for the 360 cells and all 9,774 CHIM payload files
remain byte-identical to the verified predecessor. The index and four named
town frame maps are present; town coverage and interiors are separate counts.
The 135 town-owned routing-only BSPs are absent under the validated checklist;
required map/dependency readback passed. Native boundary routing remains open.

The exact HDF comparison removes 142,235,493 payload bytes across 212 files:
135 redundant BSP maps and 77 orphan harvest catalogues. No map additions or
unexpected map removals are reported. The independently extracted RC1
playtest ZIP is 2,060,379,345 bytes. Payload savings and compressed archive
size are distinct measurements; these figures do not identify a final039 ZIP.

RC1 package and matching source delivery finalized on 13 October 2026 at
18:06:05 UTC (21:06 in Finland), with source `57a8699` and image `fbf9a6c`
kept distinct. The six partial overlaps remain outside the shipped whole-cell
count. Final v0.0.39 remains in preparation pending explicit maintainer inspection
approval; RC1 shipment does not supply maintainer or universal gameplay acceptance.

Conversion/audit data is the unchanged 13 October 2026, 14:04:49 UTC snapshot:
1,190 converted cells including 15 failed audits, 99 empty sea, three not
converted, and 1,274/1,292 audit milestones. The package layer was reconciled
at 17:45 UTC and its local served data was read back. The 865 ocean cells are
outside the denominator. Converted and packaged per-type actor/gameplay
counts remain unknown; the original reference census is preserved. Planned
cells are not included cells and package presence does not prove gameplay.
