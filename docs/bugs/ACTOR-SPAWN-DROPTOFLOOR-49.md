## Status: 23 October 2026

Open, planned for v0.0.49 (registered from ROOM-ACTORS-FLOATING-48, out of its frozen scope).

## What the game does today

engine/aga/qc/world.qc aw_npc: a resident spawns with movetype none (no gravity, no velocity) and, 0.1 s later (after
the static brushes are linked, as Quake's walkmonster_start delays droptofloor), aw_npc_floor calls the aw_npcfloor
builtin (engine/aga/src/aw_scene.c AW_NPCFloor): an exception (aw_ground_mode 1) is never moved; a resident whose
origin is its baked ground point (aw_ground_valid 1) is kept exactly and set on the ground (FL_ONGROUND); any other is
traced as a point from 8 units over its origin 32 under it and, on a walkable surface, put 0.25 over it and set on
the ground, else left where it is and retried. The trace is SV_Move, which reads a CHIM room's store models
(chim_world.c Clip -> chim_room.c ChimRoom_Clip); the room is loaded whole at map load, before the entities spawn.
A corpse (aw_corpse) spawns in its final death pose and never thinks.

## To do

Make the fallback the same computation as the build's room bake (the resident's own box straight down to the first
walkable surface, within the bake's headroom bound, 0.25 clearance; refuse start-solid, nothing hit or a lower
storey) so the two can never disagree, in the style of Quake's droptofloor (raise 1 unit, drop), without changing the
builtin's other callers. Runtime grounding for moving actors (levitation, flying creatures, jumps, swimming,
knockback, scripted SetPos) needs the fuller approach (shape sweep with a ray cross-check and a grounded state),
planned with MWScript and actor movement (wander, travel and combat packages).

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Actors and NPCs (`actors-npc`). Actor placement, models and behaviour; the actor placement gate. See [families](README.md#families).

- ACTOR-AMBIENT-STALE-EDICT-57 (no report page): Teleporting from Seyda Neen to the Ascadian Isles crashes the game: NUM_FOR_EDICT: bad pointer (ambient slots of the old map)
- ACTOR-ANNOTATE-ROOM-REFERENCE-48 (no report page): The image step stopped on a room corpse: its actor annotation looked up the support class by id alone, but room actors are classified by reference
- [ACTOR-BAKE-CENTRE-SEAM-48](ACTOR-BAKE-CENTRE-SEAM-48.md): Bradil Elarven (Glassworker's Hall) left unbaked: his centre probe falls through the seam of two floor pieces
- ACTOR-GROUND-BAKE-CHIM-ROOMS-48 (no report page): The image step stopped in the actor ground bake: it loaded the batch-room shell maps as classic collision scenes, and its error named no map
- [ACTOR-LEVELLED-NO-WANDER-56](ACTOR-LEVELLED-NO-WANDER-56.md): Levelled creatures (most wild creatures) never wander or aggro: the Wander table held placed actors only
- ACTOR-STATE-NOT-READ-ON-SPAWN-54 (no report page): A spawned actor never reads its actor record back: a killed NPC respawns alive and lowered health resets on re-entry or load
- ACTOR-STATE-POOL-LIMITS-54 (no report page): The actor record drops changes past 128 changed actors, 12 item changes or 8 spell changes per actor; package changes of the behaviour records and NPC positions are not saved
- ACTOR-STORM-POSE-51 (no report page): Requested: characters shield their eyes in ash and blight storms (the idlestorm pose), as all regular NPCs and the player do in the original, often seen in Ald'ruhn
- [ACTOR-WANDER-AGGRO-52](ACTOR-WANDER-AGGRO-52.md): Requested: NPCs and creatures wander, idle and aggro by their own record variables (AI packages, Fight), as the original game does
- AMBIENT-RESIDENTS-NOT-VISIBLE-54 (no report page): From the matched pose OpenMW shows four residents on the Seyda Neen square, AmiWind one far figure
- AMBIENT-WALK-STUCK-COLLISION-54 (no report page): Eight of 15 resident walks in the Seyda Neen MiniWind ended stuck: the step trace against the CHIM frame collision blocks most routes
- [ANIMKIT-ACTOR-ABI-SITES-35](ANIMKIT-ACTOR-ABI-SITES-35.md): With the animation kit on, the image step stopped late, one tool at a time, on actor models with more than the previous 8 or 21 frames (guard torch companions last)
- [ANIMKIT-COVERAGE-35](ANIMKIT-COVERAGE-35.md): NPCs that move or fight have no walk, run or attack animation: Fargoth and other Seyda Neen villagers glitch toward the player
- [ANIMKIT-GROUND-CHECK-LAYOUT-35](ANIMKIT-GROUND-CHECK-LAYOUT-35.md): With the animation kit on, every image step stopped: the actor ground check refused resident models with more than 8 frames
- [ANIMKIT-IMAGE-FORMATS-35](ANIMKIT-IMAGE-FORMATS-35.md): With the animation kit on, the image step stopped late on the kit's layout files: their format was unknown to the palette overlay
- [ANIMKIT-ITEM-TAG-FRAMES-35](ANIMKIT-ITEM-TAG-FRAMES-35.md): With the animation kit on, residents fought without their weapon and shield: the item tag tables had one row per kit sample, not per model frame, and the mover model had none
- AW-20260928-05 (no report page): Dock guard misses approach interception
- AW-20260929-01 (no report page): Player passes through town NPCs
- AW25-10 (no report page): Actor-contact failures stopped image assembly only after terrain
- [CAMERA-POV-TAP-LOST-36](CAMERA-POV-TAP-LOST-36.md): A Toggle POV (Tab) tap released before the next frame did not switch the view
- [CAMERA-THIRDPERSON-COMBAT-NPC-HIDDEN-36](CAMERA-THIRDPERSON-COMBAT-NPC-HIDDEN-36.md): In combat, switching to third person (Tab) hides the NPC you are fighting; it reappears back in first person
- [CHIM-ACTOR-GROUNDING-POLICY-36](CHIM-ACTOR-GROUNDING-POLICY-36.md): A CHIM area outside the shipped towns stops at its chim-town stage: the NPC grounding policy lists only the shipped towns' NPCs, and the check runs 40 minutes into the build
- CHIM-ACTOR-TABLE-BEFORE-FRAME-MAPS-48 (no report page): The CHIM actor table was written before any frame map existed, so even town residents in it carry no frame-map position (built_rows_used 0)
- COMBAT-FLYER-FLEES-57 (no report page): A cliff racer that turns hostile cannot reach the player and flees instead of diving to attack
- COMBAT-PACK-SLOTS-57 (no report page): In a pack of more than four hostiles the fifth never attacks: fallen fighters keep their combat slots
- [COMBAT-RUN-ROOT-DRIFT-33](COMBAT-RUN-ROOT-DRIFT-33.md): Arena fighters' run frames carry the root's forward motion: the body slides ahead and snaps back each cycle
- [COMPANION-NO-RUN-ANIM-33](COMPANION-NO-RUN-ANIM-33.md): The companion slides instead of walking or running, and mimic mode does not mirror the gait
- [CREATURE-BAKE-NIF-UNSUPPORTED-47](CREATURE-BAKE-NIF-UNSUPPORTED-47.md): The creature bake refuses 14 of the 39 creature meshes the outdoor world can show, the cliff racer, the rat, the guar and the nix-hound among them

- [CREATURE-DAGOTH-UR-ABSENT-52](CREATURE-DAGOTH-UR-ABSENT-52.md): Dagoth Ur and the Heart of Lorkhan are not in their rooms: the room creature list never named them, so Akulakhan s Chamber has neither
- CREATURE-RACER-DRAWN-TINY-57 (no report page): The cliff racer is drawn many times too small: a dark speck the size of a bird while its hit box is a full cliff racer
- CREATURE-SCALE-KEYS-54 (no report page): The Heart of Lorkhan beats by a scale key, and the skeletal animation table format holds no scale
- DANCER-OWN-ANIM-IGNORED-53 (no report page): The Suran dancers only idle: an NPC's own animation file (anim_dancingGirl.nif) was ignored by the skeletal actors
- DIALOGUE-FIGHT-DISPOSITION-57 (no report page): Requested: disposition drives combat as in the original: a low-disposition NPC turns hostile (effective Fight from disposition), Taunt can start a fight
- DIALOGUE-TEXT-LINKS-57 (no report page): Requested: topic names inside an answer are plain text; the original draws them as blue links that ask about the topic
- DIALOGUE-WINDOW-LAYOUT-57 (no report page): Requested: the dialogue window has no disposition bar, no Persuasion and no service entries, as the original has
- HAIR-CHECK-ACTOR-GROUND-1999-54 (no report page): The actor ground check still refused skeletal models past 1,999 vertices

- HELD-MODEL-GAPS-54 (no report page): 17 of 65 shields have no held model
- [INTERIOR-CREATURES-MISSING-41](INTERIOR-CREATURES-MISSING-41.md): No creature is placed in any interior: the resident stage takes NPC records only, so the demigod Vivec is missing from his palace

- [NPC-ORDINATOR-APPEARANCE-39](NPC-ORDINATOR-APPEARANCE-39.md): Vivec Hlaalu Ordinator has an unhelmeted Fargoth-like appearance
- [NPC-SPEAR-ATTACK-REGRESSION-39](NPC-SPEAR-ATTACK-REGRESSION-39.md): Seyda Neen guard spear attack animation is missing in first-person view

- [ROOM-RESIDENTS-NO-FIT-48](ROOM-RESIDENTS-NO-FIT-48.md): 19 batch room residents have no spot their room's collision supports: slopes, a rope bridge's hull, no floor in reach
- SKEL-ANIM-STAGE-52 (no report page): Requested: a MiniWind animation stage where NPCs of Seyda Neen and Balmora run every action from the shared table, nothing baked
- SKEL-BUDGET-SHAPES-52 (no report page): A skeletal resident with many head shapes fits no budget of the ladder: the Vivec town stage stopped on Too many separate shapes for budget
- SKEL-GROUND-SOLES-52 (no report page): Two skeletal residents found no standing spot in their CHIM rooms: the rest frame soles came out unlike the baked idle soles
- SKEL-GROUP-SPAN-52 (no report page): The beast table s spellcast group spanned 200 seconds of other animations: a phased group was cut from its first key to its last
- SKEL-ITEM-TAGS-52 (no report page): Skeletal actors draw no carried weapon, shield or torch: the item tags hold one row per model frame, and a skeletal model has every table frame
- SKEL-READERS-BLOCK-52 (no report page): The builder s readers of actor models refused or misjudged a skeletal model: the ground check stopped the build, the stream estimate called it unstreamable
