## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.35-crash-fixes-2, not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

None seen in play. `S_FindName` stopped the program (Sys_Error) for a name of 64 characters or more (`play` takes any typed name; gallery voice paths allow up to 95) and when its table of 512 sound names was full; the table is never emptied during a session, so every map, greeting and door sound adds to it.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/snd_dma.c S_FindName`.

## How it happened

Inherited from Quake, where a session never reached 512 sounds.

## Why it was not caught

Found by the fatal-path sweep of the engine (see [ENGINE-FATAL-PATH-SWEEP-35](ENGINE-FATAL-PATH-SWEEP-35.md)); no test fed this path bad or unusual input.

## Reproduction

`play` followed by 70 letters; or a long session with many maps and greetings.

## Repair

A missing, too long or table-full name returns no sound (as with nosound) and prints one console line; `S_TouchSound` and `S_PrecacheSound` handle it.

## Verification

`tests/test_engine_crash_paths.py` (source checks).

## Prevention

Every fatal path that data or a player can reach is in the sweep table, fixed or left with a reason.
