## Status: 10 October 2026

Open. Found by a source study of the original's wait and rest rules (OpenMW 0.51), not in play.

## Symptom

Standing in shallow water with the head above it, **T** opens the wait selector and the clock can be moved forward.
The original refuses waiting and resting while the player's feet are in water.

## Where

The wait check in the engine (engine/aga/src/aw_wait.c) accepts a player who is on the ground with the water level
below 2 (head dry); level 1 (feet in water) passes.

## How it happened

The wait selector was written in v0.0.23 as a plain clock advance ("waiting, not a claim of full Morrowind rest
rules"); its conditions were chosen without the original's rule for water.

## Why it was not caught

No test compared the wait conditions with the original's; the original's rest rules had not been studied.

## Reproduction

Always: walk into shallow water until the feet are wet, press T.

## Repair

Planned with the wait and rest work (roadmap: waiting and resting with the original's rules): allow waiting only
with the water level at 0, as the original does, with a host test of the condition.

## Verification

To do: a host test of the wait conditions; in game, T in shallow water is refused.

## Prevention

Every rule of the wait and rest work names its source in the original (OpenMW source, the game's own settings).
