## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on the v0.0.35 line (placements wait unlinked near the limit, farthest chunks first; the builder heap gate reads the same defines). Not yet in a build.

## Symptom

Every placement of an active chunk is linked into the leaves its box touches. The efrag pool grows in pages up to AW_EFRAG_LIMIT (65,536 links) and then ends the map with Host_Error. Nothing on the CHIM side counted towards that limit.

## Where

CHIM engine chim_chunks.c ChimChunks_Link / AddEfrags, r_efrag.c pool limit; builder CHIM heap gate.

## How it happened

The link code assumed the ring always fits; the builder only counted the records flagged over 16 leaves.

## Why it was not caught

No test or gate compared the ring's links with the pool limit.

## Reproduction

Native host test "efragcap" (a low limit: nearest linked, farthest waiting, no Host_Error) and the heap gate test in tests/test_chim_engine_native.py (or the zone and heap tests named there); before the repair it fails.

## Repair

CHIM placements stop at AW_EFRAG_LIMIT less CHIM_EFRAG_RESERVE (4,096 links for everything else). Near it a placement's leaves are counted before linking; one that would pass the limit waits unlinked (still solid, not drawn), and chunks farther than the nearest waiting one give up their links until the ring changes or the pool has stayed well below the limit for 256 frames. The chim command and dbg rcount ("ef") report waiting placements. The builder's CHIM heap gate counts the placements of every active ring (one link each at least) against the same budget, read from the engine headers (tools/engine_limits.py).

## Verification

Native host tests (compiled with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer) and the full gate. Not yet seen in a build.

## Prevention

The test stays in the native suite; the failure becomes a failed load, a wait or a counted fallback instead of the end of the map.
