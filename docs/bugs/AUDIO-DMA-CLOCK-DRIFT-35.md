# AUDIO-DMA-CLOCK-DRIFT-35: The mixer estimates the audio DMA position from the EClock, not from the hardware, so the two can drift apart over a long session

## Status: 10 October 2026

Open: registered from the engine review, not changed yet.

## Symptom

Over a long session the mixer's idea of where the audio hardware is playing can drift from where Paula really is; a drift would show as periodic crackle.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/snd_amiga.c SNDDMA_GetSamples`.

## How it happened

The audio device gives no play position, so SNDDMA_GetSamples estimates it from the EClock and the Paula period set at start-up.

## Why it was not caught

The engine came from the original sources, where these paths assumed well-formed input; no test fed them bad or unusual values.

## Reproduction

Found by reading the source (v0.0.35 engine review).

## Repair

Not changed yet. Re-anchoring needs the audio channels restarted together with the mixer's painted time, which is not a small, safe change. Next step: measure the drift per hour in a long session first.

## Verification

Not verified; open.

## Prevention

Measure before changing the audio clock.
