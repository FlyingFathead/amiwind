## Status: 9 October 2026

Repaired in the gate tooling (outside the source tree).

## Symptom

Gates failed their Windows host-parity step with import errors for NumPy and Pillow, although the source under
test had not changed.

## Where

The release gate's Windows host-parity step. It runs the host tests with an import path that offers only NumPy
and Pillow (so a test cannot lean on any other installed package). That folder lived in a temporary working
folder that is removed when its session ends.

## How it happened

The folder was made once in a temporary location and the gate pointed at it. When the temporary folder was
cleaned up, the path still pointed there and the imports failed.

## Why it was not caught

The gate did not check that its own dependencies exist before running; the step failed like a test failure.

## Reproduction

Remove the import folder and run the gate: the Windows host-parity step fails on the first NumPy or Pillow import.

## Repair

The folder now lives with the gate itself, next to its other fixed files.

## Verification

Gates since the move pass the host-parity step; gate 1160 ran with it.

## Prevention

Gate dependencies are never kept in temporary or per-session folders; the gate should check its fixed files
exist before staging.

Family: Gates, CI and tests (`tests-ci`). A check that is skipped, tests the wrong tree or depends on the host is not a check; skips fail loudly. See [families](README.md#families).
