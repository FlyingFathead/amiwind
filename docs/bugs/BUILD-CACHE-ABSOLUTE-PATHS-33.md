# BUILD-CACHE-ABSOLUTE-PATHS-33: Stage fingerprints contain absolute paths, so a moved workspace or checkout reuses nothing

## Status: 9 October 2026

Repair in v0.0.33 development (not shipped). Fingerprints hold content, not locations.

## Symptom

A build reused stages from an earlier run only when its source checkout was at the same absolute
path as the earlier run's: the v0.0.33-dev1 build had to copy its source to the folder the v0.0.32
release run had used. A different workspace also changed the NPC gallery stage's command line
(its model cache lives in the workspace).

## Where

`tools/build_cache.py`: `normalize_command` replaced only the run folder and the `--jobs` value;
the stage script, the game data folder, tool paths, the workspace and external files stayed as
absolute paths in the fingerprint, and `external_inputs` keyed files by their absolute path.

## How it happened

The run folder was the only location the first version expected to differ between builds.

## Why it was not caught

Every reuse test built both runs from one checkout in one workspace.

## Reproduction

Fingerprint one stage list twice, with the checkout and the workspace at other paths: every
stage changes (0 of 32 kept on the v0.0.33-dev1 stage list).

## Repair

On the v0.0.33 development line (not shipped): every absolute location on a command line becomes
a token (`{RUN}`, `{REPO}`, `{DATA}`, `{TOOL:name}`, `{TOOLDIR:name}`, `{WORKSPACE}`, `{PYTHON}`,
`{EXTERNAL}`); content stays in the fingerprint (game input hashes, tool hashes, repository file
hashes, external file hashes). Interpreter location variables never count. The fingerprint schema
is `amiwind-stage-cache-v2`; older runs are refused as reuse sources with that reason.

## Verification

`tests/test_build_cache.py`: the same repository copied elsewhere, with another data folder,
tool folder, workspace and external file at other paths, gives identical fingerprints, and an
external file's content still counts. Fingerprints only: the v0.0.33-dev1 stage list with the
workspace and checkout moved keeps 32 of 32 stages (0 before).

## Prevention

A test with every location moved at once.
