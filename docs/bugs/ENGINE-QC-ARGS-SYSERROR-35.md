## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.35-crash-fixes-2, not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

None seen in play. `PF_sound` called Sys_Error for volume, attenuation or channel out of range; `PF_lightstyle` wrote `sv.lightstyles[style]` for any style.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/pr_cmds.c PF_sound, PF_lightstyle`.

## How it happened

Inherited from Quake; our QuakeC passes valid values today.

## Why it was not caught

Found by the fatal-path sweep of the engine (see [ENGINE-FATAL-PATH-SWEEP-35](ENGINE-FATAL-PATH-SWEEP-35.md)); no test fed this path bad or unusual input.

## Reproduction

A QuakeC call with an out-of-range argument.

## Repair

Both are QuakeC run errors (PR_RunError: the session ends, the program stays).

## Verification

`tests/test_engine_crash_paths.py` (source checks).

## Prevention

Every fatal path that data or a player can reach is in the sweep table, fixed or left with a reason.

- MWSCRIPT-DATA-UNKNOWN-NAMES-48 (no report page): Four Bloodmoon scripts read names declared nowhere in the game data and do not compile
- MWSCRIPT-INTERIOR-PLACEMENTS-48 (no report page): Scripted placements in rooms that have no edict are not attached: the engine has no room identity to match them (3,612 of 4,907 bindings are in rooms)

- [QC-AW-FLAME-SPAWN-32](QC-AW-FLAME-SPAWN-32.md): Every aw_flame entity prints load errors: the game logic has no aw_flame spawn function or aw_flame_size/aw_flame_shape fields
