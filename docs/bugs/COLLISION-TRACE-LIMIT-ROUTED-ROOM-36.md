# COLLISION-TRACE-LIMIT-ROUTED-ROOM-36: The tool collision tracer stops on the Vivec Arena Pit's routed hull (visit limit), so its start spot cannot be traced

_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.43-dev3 (18 October 2026)._

## Status: 11 October 2026

Open. The image start check records the spot as not traced instead of failing the build.

## Symptom

The MiniWind build of `vivec-arena-pit` stopped at the end of its image step: "Cyclic or excessive collision tree". The
image start check had asked for a standing spot at the Pit's door arrival (vai000, 437.6 0.6 13.4) with the tool tracer
(`arrival_spot.standing_spot` on `audit_walkability.Scene`); the trace exceeded its visit limit within 2.5 seconds. The
stair walk's filtered tracer (`stair_walk.Collision`) stops the same way at that spot.

## Where

`tools/audit_walkability.py` `Scene.trace`: an iterative hull walk with a visit limit of max(4096, nodes x 32). A routed
standing hull shares clipnode tails between models; a segment that crosses such tails visits them once per interval,
and the count passes the limit.

## How it happened

The Arena Pit is a routed-hull room (1b53fbb). The start check is new (the partial-area start rule), and it is the first
tool to trace a spot in this room outside the stair walk's sampled steps.

## Why it was not caught

No gate traces a free spot in the Pit.

## Reproduction

`standing_spot(Collision(vai000.bsp), (437.634, 0.585, 13.409))` with the map of the run
2026_10_11_v0.0.36-dev4_miniwind-vivec-arena-pit-arena-pit-rooms_08e853b.

## Repair

Left: measure the tracer's revisits on routed hulls (and whether the engine's recursive hull check revisits the same
tails at run time), then a tracer that visits each node once per interval. Until then `direct_start.image_start_check`
records "not traced" with this ID and a warning, and the build goes on (the door arrival comes from the game data).

## Verification

`tests/test_direct_start.py` `test_image_start_check`: a tracer error is recorded as not traced with this ID.

## Prevention

A check that cannot verify says so in its receipt; it never passes silently and never fails a build on a tool limit.

Family: Collision shapes and climbing (stairs, ramps, walkways) (`stairs-collision`). Convex collision proxies invent steep faces or bury authored surfaces; Morrowind collides with authored geometry (step up 34 units, slope up to 46 degrees). Rule: follow_original_stair_rules plus a walkability gate. See [families](README.md#families).

- [BUILD-ACTOR-GATE-CHIM-FRAMES-36](BUILD-ACTOR-GATE-CHIM-FRAMES-36.md): The actor placement gate ignores CHIM frame residents: a CHIM-only build fails with no actors, and a blocked frame resident passes silently
