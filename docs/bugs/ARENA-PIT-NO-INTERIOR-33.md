_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.42-dev1 (17 October 2026)._

## Status: 11 October 2026

Persisting. v0.0.35 shipped the Pit (`vai000`) through the legacy town chain (eecb4eb, project decision D1). From v0.0.36
the Arena is a CHIM-native town and no stage made its rooms, so the Pit was in no CHIM build again: the regression
BUILD-MINIWIND-ARENA-PIT-REFUSED-36, fixed in source by the `chim-rooms-<town>` stage.

## Status: 9 October 2026

Open, by design for v0.0.33: the Arena Pit (vai000) is converted only on the arena-interiors line, not by the release builder; dbgmode arenapit falls back to the gallery floor and says so on the console only. Later: the Pit in a MiniWind scope (queued) and an on-screen notice.

## Symptom

In the maintainer's playtest the Arena minigame opened on a flat test plane instead of the Arena Pit.

## Where

builder (the Vivec Arena is withdrawn from v0.0.33; tools/build.py --extra-town vivec_arena builds the exterior only), engine/aga/src/aw_arena.c fallback.

## How it happened

v0.0.33 withdrew the Vivec Arena from the default build; the Pit interior conversion lives on a separate line that is not in the release builder. The minigame falls back to the gallery floor by design and prints "The Arena Pit is not in this build; using the gallery floor." on the console.

## Why it was not caught

The fallback message goes to the console, which a player does not see.

## Reproduction

Always.

## Repair

Not yet. (1) Show the fallback on screen in the minigame title card. (2) Build the Pit with the builder: the MiniWind Arena Pit scope (direct start, presets and the Pit interior; queued) and later the full Arena.

## Verification

None yet: an Arena MiniWind boots into the Pit; a build without it shows the on-screen notice.

## Prevention

Combat and death behaviour follow the original rules with the source named (OpenMW source, game settings); every presentation change gets a fixture or an in-game clip.
