## Status: 2 November 2026

Open, persisting: reported in v0.0.54-dev1 and again in v0.0.59. Planned for v0.0.59 with the work that keeps changed
game state across cells and saves.

## Symptom

The engine keeps a record for each character whose state has changed, up to 128 characters, with up to 12 item changes
and 8 spell changes each. Past 128 characters a new changed record is dropped, and with it a changed disposition;
changes of a character's behaviour package and their position are not saved.

## Where

The engine's actor record pool, written by the save.

## How it happened

The pool was sized for the first scenes with changed characters; a long game changes many more.

## Why it was not caught

No test changes more than 128 characters and saves.

## Reproduction

Change the state of more than 128 characters (disposition, items, spells), save, load: the later changes are missing.

## Repair

Planned: the characters' changes move to the same open-ended change list as the world's objects, keyed by the game's own
reference identity, with only the fields that changed; no fixed pool. A full pool can also outgrow the save's actor
block (SAVE-ACTOR-BLOCK-OVERFLOW-59), which goes away with it.

## Verification

Not yet: a save and reload round-trip test with more than 128 changed characters.

## Prevention

The change list has no fixed ceiling, and the save test covers a long game's numbers.

- ACTOR-ANNOTATE-ROOM-REFERENCE-48 (no report page): The image step stopped on a room corpse: its actor annotation looked up the support class by id alone, but room actors are classified by reference
- [ACTOR-BAKE-CENTRE-SEAM-48](ACTOR-BAKE-CENTRE-SEAM-48.md): Bradil Elarven (Glassworker's Hall) left unbaked: his centre probe falls through the seam of two floor pieces
- ACTOR-GROUND-BAKE-CHIM-ROOMS-48 (no report page): The image step stopped in the actor ground bake: it loaded the batch-room shell maps as classic collision scenes, and its error named no map
- [ACTOR-LEVELLED-NO-WANDER-56](ACTOR-LEVELLED-NO-WANDER-56.md): Levelled creatures (most wild creatures) never wander or aggro: the Wander table held placed actors only
- ACTOR-PACK-GUAR-MESH-BROKEN-64 (no report page): The pack guar at Ahemmusa Camp is drawn with its body parts scattered apart

- ACTOR-STATE-NOT-READ-ON-SPAWN-54 (no report page): A spawned actor never reads its actor record back: a killed NPC respawns alive and lowered health resets on re-entry or load
- ACTOR-STORM-POSE-51 (no report page): Requested: characters shield their eyes in ash and blight storms (the idlestorm pose), as all regular NPCs and the player do in the original, often seen in Ald'ruhn
- [ACTOR-WANDER-AGGRO-52](ACTOR-WANDER-AGGRO-52.md): Requested: NPCs and creatures wander, idle and aggro by their own record variables (AI packages, Fight), as the original game does
- AMBIENT-RESIDENTS-NOT-VISIBLE-54 (no report page): From the matched pose OpenMW shows four residents on the Seyda Neen square, AmiWind one far figure

- AMBIENT-WALK-STUCK-COLLISION-54 (no report page): Eight of 15 resident walks in the Seyda Neen MiniWind ended stuck: the step trace against the CHIM frame collision blocks most routes
- [ANIMKIT-ACTOR-ABI-SITES-35](ANIMKIT-ACTOR-ABI-SITES-35.md): With the animation kit on, the image step stopped late, one tool at a time, on actor models with more than the previous 8 or 21 frames (guard torch companions last)
- [ANIMKIT-COVERAGE-35](ANIMKIT-COVERAGE-35.md): NPCs that move or fight have no walk, run or attack animation: Fargoth and other Seyda Neen villagers glitch toward the player

- [CHIM-ACTOR-GROUNDING-POLICY-36](CHIM-ACTOR-GROUNDING-POLICY-36.md): A CHIM area outside the shipped towns stops at its chim-town stage: the NPC grounding policy lists only the shipped towns' NPCs, and the check runs 40 minutes into the build

- CREATURE-RACER-MESH-SPIKE-58 (no report page): The cliff racer's model is drawn broken: the wings do not join the body, the parts sit apart, and a long spike runs far below

- [CREATURE-SUMMONED-62](CREATURE-SUMMONED-62.md): The 16 creatures that summoning spells call up are not built: a summoning has no creature to show
