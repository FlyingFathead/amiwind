## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.33-dev1-build, not shipped at the time of writing.

Provenance: found in the AmiWind "MiniWind" Playtester Build runs mw-033a and mw-033b, version
0.0.33-dev1, source v0.0.33-miniwind 08d0613 and 76a324f.

## Symptom

A development build with `--reuse-from` a run that had itself reused stages listed "rebuild setup:
old outputs not reusable: created run-folder entries outside every declared stage path:
voice-lookup.json.amiwind-reuse-tmp", and every stage after setup rebuilt.

## Where

`tools/build_cache.py`, `Recorder.after`: every new top-level entry of the run folder during a
stage's window that belongs to no declared stage path makes the stage non-reusable.

## How it happened

In the earlier run, the setup stage ran while the reused dialogue-lookup stage was copied into the
run folder. The copy goes through a temporary file (`voice-lookup.json` + `.amiwind-reuse-tmp`)
that is renamed when it is complete. Setup's snapshot saw that temporary and counted it as its
own undeclared output.

## Why it was not caught

The reuse tests covered stages that run together and stages reused alone, not a stage running
while another is reused.

## Reproduction

Build with `--reuse-from` so that one stage is reused while another runs, then build again with
`--reuse-from` that run: the stage that ran is not reusable.

## Repair

The recorder ignores a new entry named after a declared run-folder root plus `.amiwind-reuse-tmp`.
Any other undeclared entry still makes the stage non-reusable.

## Verification

`test_reuse_temporaries_of_declared_roots_are_not_undeclared_outputs` (tests/test_build_cache.py).

## Prevention

Transient files of the build machinery carry one suffix and the recorder knows it.
