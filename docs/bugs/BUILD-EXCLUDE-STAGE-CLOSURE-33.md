## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.33-exclude-flags (059234a), not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

Gate 650 on the first quick test build commit: `tests/test_build_cache.py`,
`test_real_stage_closures_leave_engine_sources_to_the_engine_and_image`, failed: the input
fingerprint of `prepare_world_scenery.py` covered every file of `engine/aga/src/`. A native
host test (`aga_debug_scene_test.c`, which includes `aw_intro.c`) failed to link the new
`AW_ContentExcludedSay` as well.

## Where

`tools/build_parallel.py`, `stage_dependencies`, imported `tools/build_exclusions.py` to learn
which stages a quick test build skips; that module imported `project_version.py` (the rc/final
refusal), which names the engine folder. `tests/test_aga_native_source.py` added the marker
module only when a test compiled `aw_intro.c` itself, not when its fixture included it.

## How it happened

The stage cache follows every import of a stage's code, and stage code imports the scheduler
(the shared worker pool), so the table became part of every conversion stage's fingerprint.

## Why it was not caught

The branch's own focused tests passed; the cache test runs in the full suite only, which is
what the gate is for.

## Reproduction

On v0.0.33-exclude-flags 22c20ce, run the cache test above.

## Repair

The scheduler, the stage cache and the profiler get the skipped stages from the build receipt
(`excluded_content.skipped_stages`, `build_parallel.plan_skipped`) and never import the table;
the NPC gallery has its own reference-closure filter; native host tests whose fixture includes
`aw_movie.c`, `aw_scene.c` or `aw_intro.c` get the marker module.

## Verification

Gate 651 on 059234a: 1772 tests, no failures; engine build with no warnings.

## Prevention

The cache test guards the closures; `tests/test_build_exclusions.py` checks that the scheduler
refuses a plan gap without the receipt's skipped stages and accepts it with them.

- [BUILD-SCHEDULER-EVEN-SHARE-33](BUILD-SCHEDULER-EVEN-SHARE-33.md): The stage scheduler splits the workers evenly between running stages, so the longest stage gets no more than the shortest (MiniWind media on 1 of 4 workers for 1,195 s)
