## Status: 18 October 2026

Repaired on the v0.0.43 line (branch v0.0.43-imgpar); verified on the v0.0.43-dev2 run's own inputs (see
Verification). Fixed when a full build on the repaired builder passes its perf guard.

## Symptom

The v0.0.43-dev2 full build (`2026_10_18_v0.0.43-dev2_full-batch3_f29d984`) passed every stage and failed its perf
guard: "Image: CHIM region frame maps", 1,295 frames, 61 s on 1.13 of 20 cores with independent units (FIX-NOW). In
the same image step "Image: CHIM frame maps" took 1 min 39 s on 1.08 cores and "Image: finalize" 8 min 13 s on 1.63
cores. The region pass cache had 0 hits against the previous run.

Measured from the run's own build profile (sections, seconds of wall time):

| Part | Time | Cores | What it was |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entity tracker placements (before "Image: entity tracker") | 137 s | 1 | the CHIM world read and checked four times: once per CHIM town (3) and once for the region cells |
| Image: CHIM world read | 29 s | 1 | the fifth read |
| Image: CHIM town frame maps | 7 s | 1 | five frame maps one after another |
| Image: CHIM region frame maps, task preparation | 48 s | 1 | per frame: the player start's ground traced on a scene of the whole frame (every chunk and every placement's hull relocated, about 45 ms a frame) |
| Image: CHIM region frame maps, pool | 13 s | 1.6 | the maps on the pool; the door bank rows (each frame's scenery index read) in the parent |
| Image: CHIM frame-map heap | 38 s | 1.3 | 35 s of it the sixth read of the world, 3 s the pool |

## Where

`tools/build_aga.py` (the image step: `chim_town_placements`, `chim_region_placements`, `chim_frame_maps`),
`tools/chim/frame_map.py` (`frame_ground`, `build_regions`, `region_cache`), `tools/chim/heap.py`
(`frame_map_heap`), `tools/chim/collision.py` (`FrameScene`).

## How it happened

- Each reader of the CHIM world in the image step called `chim.frame_map.load` itself; the world grew to 1,298 frames
  and 33,056 models, about 30 s a read.
- `frame_ground` (CHIM-FRAME-GROUND-TRACE-38) traces one vertical line at the frame centre but built the scene of the
  whole frame for it.
- BUILD-IMAGE-CHIM-MAPS-SERIAL-36 put the map writing on the pool; the task preparation in front of it grew later.

Cache miss: for the 142 frame maps both runs made, only the pass's source digest differed. The region cache is keyed by
the code its worker reaches, and that code reaches `tools/chim/models.py`, whose import-time code changed between the
two commits (282eff7, CHIM-HULL-ROUTE-NO-CUT-43: a new module constant naming `config/chim-compiled-hull-meshes.json`).
No frame map reads that table: the key is broader than its inputs (a whole module's import-time code counts). The
same check showed the key also too narrow: it named `_region_map`, the legacy-rows method only, so the default
game-data method (`_region_map_game_data`, `static_check`, `native_activated_check`) was not in it and an edit there
would have reused stale frame maps.

## Why it was not caught

The perf guard caught it at the end of the build (it has no baseline for the finalize sections, only for the region
frame maps). No check counted world reads per image step.

## Reproduction

Always: any full build with CHIM region frames; read the image step's sections in build-profile.json.

## Repair

- The CHIM world is read once for the image step (`build_aga.chim_world_once`, phase "Image: CHIM world read") and
  handed to the entity tracker's placements, the frame maps and the frame-map heap gate (`frame_map_heap(world=)`),
  then released after the heap gate.
- `frame_ground` builds a column scene (`FrameScene(column=)`): only the chunks and placements whose box holds the
  traced line, in the same order, with the visit guard counting the whole frame's nodes (`full_nodes`), so every trace
  gives the whole scene's result.
- The region pool worker (`region_unit`) makes the door bank rows too; the parent only writes, in table order.
- The town frame maps and Seyda Neen's special maps run on the pool (`town_unit`), each with only its frame's part of
  the world (`frame_subworld`), each writing only its own map.
- The region cache is keyed by `_region_frame_map`, which reaches both row methods. The changed key makes every region
  frame map once in the next build (about 13 s on the pool).
- Serial parts say why in their log line (the world read; the task preparation, which reads the world held in the
  parent).

Not changed (key breadth): a module's import-time code still counts as a whole in every pass key (build_cache
`<top>`); narrowing it to the statements a worker reaches is a change to every cache key and is proposed separately.

## Verification

On scratch copies of the dev2 run's own id1 and CHIM world, the commit before the repair and the repaired code side
by side (pass cache off): see the journal entry of 18 October 2026 for the measured times and the file-by-file
SHA-256 comparison. Tests: `tests/test_image_region_maps_serial.py`, `tests/test_chim_collision.py` (column scene
traces equal the whole scene's), `tests/test_chim_regions.py` (one worker or several: same bytes).

## Prevention

The tests above; the perf guard's FIX-NOW on the section.

- [BUILD-CHIM-STAIR-JOBS-AT-LAUNCH-42](BUILD-CHIM-STAIR-JOBS-AT-LAUNCH-42.md): In-stage pools of the CHIM step stay at the --jobs the stage was launched with: the v0.0.42 final's stair gate walked on 2 workers with an allowance of 12
- [BUILD-CHIM-STAIR-NO-REUSE-42](BUILD-CHIM-STAIR-NO-REUSE-42.md): The v0.0.42 final walked all 1,118 frames again: the walks of the passed dev1 build carry no check mark, because its launcher never promotes them
- [BUILD-CHIM-STATS-SERIAL-TAIL-36](BUILD-CHIM-STATS-SERIAL-TAIL-36.md): The chim stage ended with its statistics validating the whole CHIM world a second time, on one core with no output (7 min 44 s on 273 frames)

- [BUILD-PROGRESS-ETA-BASIS-36](BUILD-PROGRESS-ETA-BASIS-36.md): The live build progress took a stage's expected time from earlier runs of any size: dev3's chim stage was expected at 154 s and ran 1 h 48 min
- [BUILD-REUSE-APPLY-SERIAL-41](BUILD-REUSE-APPLY-SERIAL-41.md): A reused stage staged its files one at a time: world terrain, scenery and flora took 8 to 12 seconds each, one after another, at the start of every reuse build

- [BUILD-STAIR-WALK-BORDER-COPIES-41](BUILD-STAIR-WALK-BORDER-COPIES-41.md): The CHIM stair gate walks every frame's whole border, so each cell's flights are walked many times and unreachable copies can fail a build
- [BUILD-STAIR-WALK-SLOW-33](BUILD-STAIR-WALK-SLOW-33.md): The image step's stair walk spent most of its time in interpreted collision traces and brute-force headroom tests (1,751 s of the rc1c image step)
- [BUILD-STATS-SERIAL-36](BUILD-STATS-SERIAL-36.md): The CHIM stats step runs serially and silently on one core

- [MINIWIND-SCENE-CHAIN-WEIGHT-42](MINIWIND-SCENE-CHAIN-WEIGHT-42.md): Every MiniWind bakes all playable races and the opening rooms, and walks its whole frame stairs
- [NPC-BAKED-WHOLE-DUPLICATION-33](NPC-BAKED-WHOLE-DUPLICATION-33.md): Every NPC appearance is baked whole: shared body parts are converted again for each actor, and equipment cannot change
