## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.35-crash-fixes-2, not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

None seen in play. `Cbuf_InsertText` (exec, aliases) wrote the waiting command tail back with SZ_Write, which stops the program when it does not fit; `Cbuf_Execute` copied each line into `line[1024]` without a bound.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/cmd.c Cbuf_InsertText, Cbuf_Execute`.

## How it happened

Inherited from Quake.

## Why it was not caught

Found by the fatal-path sweep of the engine (see [ENGINE-FATAL-PATH-SWEEP-35](ENGINE-FATAL-PATH-SWEEP-35.md)); no test fed this path bad or unusual input.

## Reproduction

`exec` of a file near 8 KiB while commands wait, or a config line longer than 1023 characters.

## Repair

The insert is refused with "Cbuf_InsertText: overflow" when the text and the waiting tail do not fit together; a longer line is cut at the buffer.

## Verification

`tests/test_engine_crash_paths.py` (source checks).

## Prevention

Every fatal path that data or a player can reach is in the sweep table, fixed or left with a reason.
