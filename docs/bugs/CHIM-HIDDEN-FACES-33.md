## Status: 8 October 2026

Open; performance. Found by the CHIM builder (M2) while checking the Seyda Neen frame map against
the recorded region maps.

## Symptom

Each recorded Seyda Neen region map has a worldspawn key `aw_render_pool` and per-placement
`aw_render_ranges`. The legacy terrain cull removed the faces of placed models that lie under the
ground (`canonical_bsp_cull.py`), and the engine draws only the kept face ranges
(`aw_render_ranges.c`). The CHIM world stores each model once and draws it whole, so those hidden
faces are drawn again (and clipped by the terrain).

## Where

`tools/canonical_bsp_cull.py` (legacy, per region map); CHIM model records (`tools/chim/`). The
CHIM frame map leaves the region-only key out (`frame_map.PER_MAP_KEYS`).

## How it happened

The cull is computed per region map, against that map's own bounded terrain, and stored in the
map. CHIM shares one model record among every placement, so a per-placement face subset has no
place in the format yet.

## Why it was not caught

Balmora's region maps have no render pools, so the first CHIM frames had nothing to compare.

## Reproduction

Read the worldspawn of any recorded `sn###.bsp`: `aw_render_pool` is present and differs per region.

## Repair

Not decided. Measure first: faces drawn and clipped on the Seyda Neen cameras with the renderer
counters (`dbg rcount`), CHIM against the legacy maps. Options if it matters: a per-placement face
mask in the placement record, or terrain-aware model variants.

## Verification

Pending: the counters table for Seyda Neen.

## Prevention

The frame map records which per-region keys it leaves out (`per_map_worldspawn_keys_left_out`).
