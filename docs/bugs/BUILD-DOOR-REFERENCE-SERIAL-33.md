## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed in source on the v0.0.33 stage-parallel branch, not shipped. Present in the v0.0.32 builder.

## Symptom

`prepare_doors.prepare` writes the private interior reference (`interior-reference.json`) by
calling `read_interior` for every destination cell of the converted doors, and each call parses
the whole 80 MB `Morrowind.esm` again. It ran for about 72 s on one core in every stage that maps
doors: interior (the prison ship), census, area and balmora-interiors (through `populate`). In the
v0.0.32 from-scratch build this was the one-core tail of area (about 60 s) and of
balmora-interiors (about 80 s); a stage-only run of interior spent 72 s of its 129.5 s there.

## Where

`tools/prepare_doors.py` `interior_reference`; `src/mwad/interior.py` `read_interior`.

## How it happened

`read_interior` was written for one room; the door reference reused it in a loop when the number of
destination cells was small.

## Why it was not caught

Stages had no section timers until the stage-parallel profiling; the time showed only as an idle
tail of each stage.

## Reproduction

Stage-only run of interior with section timers: section `prepare` (prepare_doors) 1m12s at 1.0 core.

## Repair

`read_interiors(path, names)` reads several cells in one pass over the master; `read_interior` is
the one-name case of it. Each result equals a separate `read_interior` call (base records copied
per cell, as separate calls produced them). The door step uses it.

## Verification

`tests/test_harvest_room.py` `test_one_pass_reader_equals_one_call_per_cell` (fixture master:
results equal per-cell calls with and without interior entrances, cells do not share base records,
missing cells still fail by name). Stage-only interior run from the v0.0.32 release inputs
(4 CPUs, busy host): 129.5 s -> 59.4 s, all 95 output files byte-identical; door section 72 s -> 5.8 s.

## Prevention

The test above; section timers on the stages that map doors.
