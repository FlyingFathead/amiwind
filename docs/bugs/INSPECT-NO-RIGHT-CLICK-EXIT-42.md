_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.42-dev2 (17 October 2026)._

## Symptom

With the inspect panel filling the view (INSPECT-OVER-VIEWPORT-42) the only way out was opening the console and
typing `dbg hud off`. The maintainer, 17 October 2026: inspect mode should also be left with a right click.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/aw_inspect.c` (mode switch), `engine/aga/src/keys.c` (key dispatch).

## How it happened

The mode was designed as a console toggle; the left button was taken over for pinning, the right one kept its
game binding (`+aw_alt`, block).

## Why it was not caught

No test or doc asked how a player leaves the mode.

## Reproduction

`dbg hud on`, then try to leave it without the console.

## Repair

A right click (the Amiga's right button arrives as `K_MOUSE3`; the middle button `K_MOUSE2` too) leaves inspect
mode exactly like `dbg hud off`: pin cleared, overlays off, view size back, a held attack is not released into
combat. The click is consumed (it does not also raise the shield). Outside inspect mode the buttons keep their
bindings. The hint row says it ("INSPECT: click pin / right exit"); docs/AMIWIND_CONSOLE_COMMANDS.md and
docs/KEYMAPS.md list it.

## Verification

`tests/aga_inspect_test.c`: K_MOUSE3 and K_MOUSE2 leave the mode, any other key does not, nothing happens while
the mode is off, no attack leaks after the exit. In game: pending.

## Prevention

The same test.
