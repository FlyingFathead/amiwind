## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.35-crash-fixes-2, not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

None seen in play. Entity keys (`keyname[64]`, `[256]`), vector values (`string[128]`), the angle hack (`temp[32]`), `PR_ValueString`/`PR_UglyValueString` (`line[256]`: every saved string went through it), `PR_GlobalString`, `PF_VarString` (`out[256]`, all print builtins), the sign-on message (the map text was the format of `sprintf`), demo and server precache and player names, alias frame names (16 bytes without a NUL), and the print buffers (`vsprintf` into 1 KiB) had no bound.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/pr_edict.c, pr_cmds.c, sv_main.c, cl_parse.c, cl_demo.c, model.c, console.c, host.c`.

## How it happened

Inherited from Quake.

## Why it was not caught

Found by the fatal-path sweep of the engine (see [ENGINE-FATAL-PATH-SWEEP-35](ENGINE-FATAL-PATH-SWEEP-35.md)); no test fed this path bad or unusual input.

## Reproduction

A map "message" with a percent sign; a map or save string longer than the buffers.

## Repair

Bounded copies (`Q_snprintf`, `vsnprintf`) everywhere listed; saved strings are written whole, not through `line[]`; the map message is data, not a format; a demo or server name longer than MAX_QPATH ends the session; demo, save and load paths leave room for the extension; an empty path no longer walks before its buffer.

## Verification

`tests/test_engine_crash_paths.py`: native fixture for PF_VarString; source checks for the rest.

## Prevention

Every fatal path that data or a player can reach is in the sweep table, fixed or left with a reason.

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Engine table limits (`engine-limits`). Fixed engine tables (models, entities, faces, texinfo, flames, lamps, door rows) are checked by the builder before a map ships, never discovered in play. See [families](README.md#families).
