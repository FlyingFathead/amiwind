## Status: 23 October 2026

Open; found while fixing ROOM-ACTORS-FLOATING-48, not yet seen in game.

## Finding

The engine's CHIM room collision (engine/aga/src/chim/chim_room.c ChimRoom_Clip, called from SV_Move through
aw_chim_clip) tests a placement only when the move's box, grown by 1 unit, meets the placement's drawn box. The
build's room collision for the checks (tools/chim/room_scene.py RoomScene) traces every placement. In ri68c97f8719
(dev2 try 11) the hull of placement 91935 reaches 1.01 units past its store model's bounds: the room actor bake's
first, bounds-filtered contact test passed a spot for Sitialius Catanius that the full collision then failed (the bake
now accepts a spot only on the full collision). If the drawn box is the model bounds too, a trace at such an edge in
game can miss collision the build counted.

## Next

Measure, over the interior store, how far each model's hull reaches past its drawn box, and grow the clip test's box
by that (or store the hull's own bounds).

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Collision shapes and climbing (stairs, ramps, walkways) (`stairs-collision`). Convex collision proxies invent steep faces or bury authored surfaces; Morrowind collides with authored geometry (step up 34 units, slope up to 46 degrees). Rule: follow_original_stair_rules plus a walkability gate. See [families](README.md#families).

- [BUILD-ACTOR-GATE-CHIM-FRAMES-36](BUILD-ACTOR-GATE-CHIM-FRAMES-36.md): The actor placement gate ignores CHIM frame residents: a CHIM-only build fails with no actors, and a blocked frame resident passes silently
- [BUILD-FLORA-STAIR-PLATES-BUDGET-36](BUILD-FLORA-STAIR-PLATES-BUDGET-36.md): The stair-plate collision rules raised a legacy open-world map past the BSP clip-node limit: world-flora failed on vf0779 (33,172 aggregate clipnodes > 32,767)
- [BUILD-HULL-ROUTE-BUDGET-33](BUILD-HULL-ROUTE-BUDGET-33.md): Routed standing hulls with copies overflow a legacy map's shared clipnode budget
- [BUILD-ROUTED-FLORA-RESERVE-33](BUILD-ROUTED-FLORA-RESERVE-33.md): Routed standing hulls push a legacy open-world map past the flora collision reserve: the full build stops in world-flora (vf0779)
- [BUILD-STAIR-FLAG-INERT-32](BUILD-STAIR-FLAG-INERT-32.md): The stair rule build option does nothing in v0.0.32
- [BUILD-STAIR-WALK-BRUTE-FORCE-46](BUILD-STAIR-WALK-BRUTE-FORCE-46.md): The builder walks every step of the island to find out whether its own collision can be walked, an answer the game data already holds
- [CHIM-HULL-STAIR-EDGE-33](CHIM-HULL-STAIR-EDGE-33.md): With the qbsp-compiled terrain hull on Balmora's regular ground, one flight of stairs fails at a chunk edge
- [CHIM-HULL-SURFACE-RESURVEY-48](CHIM-HULL-SURFACE-RESURVEY-48.md): The v0.0.48-dev2 build stopped at the collision surface gate in Balmora: the gate measured treads stair method 1 removed, and the hull-surface table was measured under the old collision defaults
- [CHIM-SEYDA-EXPANDED-STAIRS-40](CHIM-SEYDA-EXPANDED-STAIRS-40.md): Expanded Seyda CHIM frame fails stair walks at two original references
- [CHIM-STAIR-COLLISION-MESH-47](CHIM-STAIR-COLLISION-MESH-47.md): Stair collision method 1: a stairway collision mesh per flight, proven by a geometric check instead of a walk
- [CHIM-STAIR-GATE-POOL-BROKEN-42](CHIM-STAIR-GATE-POOL-BROKEN-42.md): The CHIM stair gate of a whole-Vivec MiniWind stopped the build: a walk worker was killed
- [CHIM-STAIR-METHOD1-UNFIXED-48](CHIM-STAIR-METHOD1-UNFIXED-48.md): Stair collision method 1 cannot yet make 11 meshes' flights pass the geometric stair check (ships, shipwreck, silt strider, tent, Daedric ruins and four buildings)
- [CHIM-VIVEC-DOCK-WALKWAY-43](CHIM-VIVEC-DOCK-WALKWAY-43.md): The player cannot climb the walkway at the Vivec Hlaalu canton dock and gets stuck
- [CHIM-VOS-TEMPLE-WALKWAY-41](CHIM-VOS-TEMPLE-WALKWAY-41.md): Vos walkway stair starts inside the Velothi temple's collision and fails the stair gate
- [COLLISION-CONVEX-LOSS-32](COLLISION-CONVEX-LOSS-32.md): Convex collision proxies lose and invent authored surfaces
- [COLLISION-HULL-CHAINS-33](COLLISION-HULL-CHAINS-33.md): 183 brush models across the island collide through standing-hull chains 512 to 31,659 clipnodes deep
- [COLLISION-NC-FLAGS-32](COLLISION-NC-FLAGS-32.md): Morrowind no-collision and editor-marker flags (NC, NCC, MRK, AvoidNode) are ignored by the mesh converters
- [COLLISION-RCN-SCOPE-32](COLLISION-RCN-SCOPE-32.md): Authored collision meshes (RootCollisionNode) are used by some converters only
- [COLLISION-ROUTE-NO-SPLIT-36](COLLISION-ROUTE-NO-SPLIT-36.md): Routed standing hulls of dense flora (kelp, kreshweed) stay one chain 277-305 clipnodes deep: the router finds no cut, so the cell stays hull-pending
- [COLLISION-SEYDA-PREVIEW-BYPASS-32](COLLISION-SEYDA-PREVIEW-BYPASS-32.md): The legacy Seyda Neen preview builds its own convex collision
- [COLLISION-STAIR-SLOPE-32](COLLISION-STAIR-SLOPE-32.md): Convex collision proxies make stairs unclimbable
- [COLLISION-TRACE-COST-33](COLLISION-TRACE-COST-33.md): Movement traces near large models walk long standing-hull chains: tens of ms per trace on a slow 68040 (emulator-relative)
- [COLLISION-TRACE-LIMIT-ROUTED-ROOM-36](COLLISION-TRACE-LIMIT-ROUTED-ROOM-36.md): The tool collision tracer stops on the Vivec Arena Pit's routed hull (visit limit), so its start spot cannot be traced
- [ROOM-PYLON-ROOF-48](ROOM-PYLON-ROOF-48.md): Grand Inquisitor and Tamira Vian (Hall of Processing) stand inside collision: a convex piece of ex_stronghold_pylon01 slopes 14 units over the floor they stand on
- [ROOM-X-MESH-ROOF-SURVEY-48](ROOM-X-MESH-ROOF-SURVEY-48.md): 57 more exterior meshes placed in rooms have a convex collision piece standing more than a step over their own floor
- [SEYDA-BLOCK-31](SEYDA-BLOCK-31.md): Invisible obstacle blocks the path on a Seyda Neen slope
- [STAIR-DETECT-POSITION-41](STAIR-DETECT-POSITION-41.md): Stair step detection depends on where a frame puts the placement: a few borderline steps are found in one frame's copy and not in another's
- [STAIR-FLIGHT-CORE-SPLIT-41](STAIR-FLIGHT-CORE-SPLIT-41.md): The stair gate marks flights per 1024-unit core: a flight that crosses a core line loses its flight mark, so its failures do not stop a build
