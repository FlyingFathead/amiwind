## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.35-mwad-fixes, not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

write_text and open(...,"w") without newline and encoding write CRLF on Windows hosts and the locale encoding; the output hash then depends on the host.

## Where

The Morrowind data readers in src/mwad and the input and closure tools.

## How it happened

The readers grew separately, each with its own copy of the small helpers.

## Why it was not caught

Owner data is well formed, so the differences never showed; found by code review.

## Reproduction

Feed the reader a synthetic record with the unusual form (see the test).

## Repair

audit, paths (workspace.json) and prepare_scenery pin newline LF and UTF-8; tests/test_text_writers.py refuses unpinned writers in src/ and ratchets the remaining ones in tools/ (never more than the listed counts).

## Verification

tests/test_text_writers.py; stage outputs on the owner data compared by hash tree against the reuse source.

## Prevention

One shared module for these helpers; new readers import it. The writer scan test refuses new unpinned writers.

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Gates, CI and tests (`tests-ci`). A check that is skipped, tests the wrong tree or depends on the host is not a check; skips fail loudly. See [families](README.md#families).

- CI-01 (no report page): Windows short aliases mismatch resolved discovery paths in tests
- [CI-BOOTSTRAP-NUMPY-32](CI-BOOTSTRAP-NUMPY-32.md): The public CI tool bootstrap fails: tools/build.py imports numpy before the tools exist
- [CI-ERICW-SKIP-31](CI-ERICW-SKIP-31.md): Torch test room test never runs in hosted CI or the builder image
- [CI-HOSTDEPS-30](CI-HOSTDEPS-30.md): Host CI job fails: scenery export needs the NIF reader for non-NIF test data
- [CI-SKIPS-UNGUARDED-31](CI-SKIPS-UNGUARDED-31.md): Hosted CI does not fail on skipped tests; JavaScript test coverage unpinned
- [CI-SUITE-TWICE-33](CI-SUITE-TWICE-33.md): Hosted CI runs the full test suite twice per revision
- [GATE-EMBERS-31](GATE-EMBERS-31.md): Ember commit broke native torch tests and a header format check
- [GATE-HOSTPARITY-TEMP-RACE-33](GATE-HOSTPARITY-TEMP-RACE-33.md): Two gates running at once share the host-parity step's log file, so one gate can report the other's error
- [GATE-NODE-MISSING-31](GATE-NODE-MISSING-31.md): The local gate never runs the inspector JavaScript tests (no Node.js in the Docker images)
- [GATE-NUMPY-PATH-SCRATCH-33](GATE-NUMPY-PATH-SCRATCH-33.md): The gate's NumPy and Pillow import folder lived in a temporary per-session folder, so gates broke once it was removed
- [GATE-PRIVACY-SCAN-33](GATE-PRIVACY-SCAN-33.md): The source preflight does not scan file contents for tool or model names and private path prefixes
- [GATE-SHARED-SOURCE-32](GATE-SHARED-SOURCE-32.md): The local gate always tested the main checkout, in one shared folder
- [GATE-SOURCE-RACE-33](GATE-SOURCE-RACE-33.md): The local gate copies the working tree after its clean check, so edits during the copy reach the tested source
- [GATE-SUITE-WRITABLE-32](GATE-SUITE-WRITABLE-32.md): The test suite needs a writable source copy and an executable /tmp; the documented command does not say so
- LINUX-VALID-02 (no report page): Linux test fixtures failed to link (missing stubs)
- [RELEASE-PATCH-SIZE-33](RELEASE-PATCH-SIZE-33.md): The release preflight refuses the whitespace baseline of v0.0.33-dev1 as oversized text
- [TEST-CHIM-BIG-FRAME-TIMEOUT-33](TEST-CHIM-BIG-FRAME-TIMEOUT-33.md): The Balmora-sized CHIM world test times out on a busy host
- [TEST-COST-ORDER-LOAD-33](TEST-COST-ORDER-LOAD-33.md): The scheduler cost-order test fails on a fully loaded host (start times compared within a fraction of a second)
- [TEST-ENV-LEAK-HULL-33](TEST-ENV-LEAK-HULL-33.md): A sequential run of the suite fails the CHIM unit fingerprint test: an earlier in-process test leaves AMIWIND_MODEL_HULL set
- [TEST-NATIVE-STALE-IMPORT-33](TEST-NATIVE-STALE-IMPORT-33.md): Native engine tests run alone generate their version headers with the builder image's old tools copy
- [TEST-NATIVE-TMPDIR-32](TEST-NATIVE-TMPDIR-32.md): A native test overflows a 64-byte name buffer when the temp path is long
- [TEST-PARALLEL-ORDER-LOAD-33](TEST-PARALLEL-ORDER-LOAD-33.md): The process-pool order test fails on a fully loaded host (one worker process takes every item)
- TEST-PORT-01 (no report page): Focused tests depended on repo root and Windows UTF-8 mode
- TEST-PORTABILITY-01 (no report page): Pre-release test fixtures assumed host features and links
- [TEST-PROFILE-SECTION-CPU-32](TEST-PROFILE-SECTION-CPU-32.md): The build profile section test fails on a loaded host (CPU time read in clock ticks)
- [TEST-PROFILE-STAGE-WALL-32](TEST-PROFILE-STAGE-WALL-32.md): The build profile stage test needs an idle host (wall time compared with CPU time)
- [TEST-PROFILE-TIMELINE-BOUND-33](TEST-PROFILE-TIMELINE-BOUND-33.md): A profiler test bounds the sampled CPU too tightly and fails on a busy host
- [TEST-PROFILE-TIMELINE-SUM-33](TEST-PROFILE-TIMELINE-SUM-33.md): The build profile test's sampled-timeline check fails on a loaded host (timeline CPU above the stage's own CPU)
- [TEST-WORKER-SYSPATH-32](TEST-WORKER-SYSPATH-32.md): Pool workers started from tests import tools/mwad.py instead of the mwad package
- [TOOLKIT-TEST-POINTERLOCK-31](TOOLKIT-TEST-POINTERLOCK-31.md): Inspector test left pointer lock set, breaking later drag checks
