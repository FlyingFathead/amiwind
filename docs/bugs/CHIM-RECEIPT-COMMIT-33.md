## Status: 9 October 2026

Open. Found while filling the found-in-build records of the bug tracker.

## Symptom

The first CHIM preview playtest build (CHIM Preview 1) names its engine commit (0d8bf4f) and world
format (0.4), but not the commit of the builder that wrote its CHIM Balmora world. The world's own
receipts (`chim-receipt.json`, `chim-source.json`, `chim-stats.json`) record the builder type, CHIM
version and world format, and no commit. A bug seen in that preview
([CHIM-TEXTURE-SPECKS-33](CHIM-TEXTURE-SPECKS-33.md)) could only be traced to "the v0.0.33-chim-format
branch before 8caf66e" from the build time.

## Where

CHIM stage receipts (tools/chim); build receipts of overlay-assembled previews. Builds packaged by the
repository builder record `source_commit` in `build.json`, and their CHIM world comes from the same run.

## How it happened

The CHIM stage was first run on its own (outside a full build) to produce test worlds; its receipt was
written for content checks (files, sizes, CRCs, statistics), not provenance.

## Why it was not caught

No check required a commit in a CHIM receipt, and the tracker had no field that needed one.

## Reproduction

Open the CHIM receipt of any stand-alone CHIM stage run: there is no commit field.

## Repair

Not repaired. Planned: the CHIM stage writes the source commit (and a dirty-tree flag) into
`chim-receipt.json`, and a build that takes its CHIM world from another run records that commit as its
world commit.

## Verification

None yet.

## Prevention

The tracker now requires the found-in-build record (playtest version, source, engine and world commits,
CHIM version, world format) for every CHIM bug; `tools/bug_register.py set ID --from-build build.json`
fills it from a build receipt, and an unknown value needs a stated reason.

Family: CHIM world streamer (`chim-streamer`). The CHIM streamer keeps Quake's visibility effective and its renderer counters must not get worse. See [families](README.md#families).

- [CHIM-ACTOR-RING-33](CHIM-ACTOR-RING-33.md): A scripted actor step could move the CHIM chunk ring to the actor
- [CHIM-ACTORS-OUTSIDE-RING-33](CHIM-ACTORS-OUTSIDE-RING-33.md): Actors outside the CHIM ring have no terrain collision

- [CHIM-ARENA-MEMORY-33](CHIM-ARENA-MEMORY-33.md): The Vivec Arena does not fit the CHIM zone: canton bodies are single models of 1.4-2.5 MB
- [CHIM-BORDER-COLLISION-33](CHIM-BORDER-COLLISION-33.md): Collision near CHIM chunk borders ignores the neighbour chunk's ground
- [CHIM-CHUNK-LOAD-FAIL-33](CHIM-CHUNK-LOAD-FAIL-33.md): Balmora chunks fail to load on CHIM, never recover, and leave holes without ground
- [CHIM-FAR-OBJECTS-33](CHIM-FAR-OBJECTS-33.md): Houses between the CHIM ring and the legacy overlap depth are missing from the fogged horizon
- [CHIM-FAR-TERRAIN-33](CHIM-FAR-TERRAIN-33.md): A CHIM frame has no distant ground: beyond the active ring the land is missing (empty valleys, Vivec not visible from the world)
- [CHIM-FRAME-WORLD-BOUNDS-33](CHIM-FRAME-WORLD-BOUNDS-33.md): A CHIM frame map must carry an empty world whose bounds cover the frame
- [CHIM-FROZEN-ACTORS-33](CHIM-FROZEN-ACTORS-33.md): Frozen CHIM actors: projectiles stop mid-air and timers stop
- [CHIM-GRAFT-REPACK-EMPTY-33](CHIM-GRAFT-REPACK-EMPTY-33.md): A frame world repack without room for the whole ring drops every chunk: the world vanishes and the player falls under Seyda Neen
- [CHIM-HARVEST-NAMING-33](CHIM-HARVEST-NAMING-33.md): A town-wide CHIM harvest catalogue does not fit the name and size limits
- [CHIM-HARVEST-REMOVED-MAPS-33](CHIM-HARVEST-REMOVED-MAPS-33.md): A pure CHIM image stops at the save fingerprint: harvest catalogues of the removed town region maps have no matching map
- [CHIM-HIDDEN-FACES-33](CHIM-HIDDEN-FACES-33.md): CHIM draws placed-model faces under the terrain that the recorded Seyda Neen region maps cull
- [CHIM-HULL-CHAIN-COST-33](CHIM-HULL-CHAIN-COST-33.md): Large placed models collide through one long chain of convex pieces: a trace near the Arena canton walks about 6,600 planes
- [CHIM-HULL2-33](CHIM-HULL2-33.md): CHIM terrain uses the player hull for large entities
- [CHIM-LEAF-SPAN-33](CHIM-LEAF-SPAN-33.md): 160 of 1,488 Balmora placements span more than 16 leaves
- [CHIM-LIGHT-CONTENTS-33](CHIM-LIGHT-CONTENTS-33.md): Actor lighting and water contents ignore CHIM chunks
- [CHIM-PACK-DIRS-33](CHIM-PACK-DIRS-33.md): CHIM pack directories are fully resident and would grow to about 400 KB for the island
- [CHIM-PAYLOAD-PARITY-33](CHIM-PAYLOAD-PARITY-33.md): The CHIM world misses the image step's edits to Balmora (harvest mushrooms, town flora)
- [CHIM-PVS-HOLLOW-33](CHIM-PVS-HOLLOW-33.md): Chunk visibility culls almost nothing in Balmora: houses have hollow collision shells
- [CHIM-READ-BUDGET-33](CHIM-READ-BUDGET-33.md): CHIM per-frame read budget can be exceeded by a whole lump
- [CHIM-REBUILD-COST-33](CHIM-REBUILD-COST-33.md): Each CHIM crossing rebuilds the whole frame world; the cost is not measured
- [CHIM-SEYDA-ACTOR-CONTACT-33](CHIM-SEYDA-ACTOR-CONTACT-33.md): rc1 image step refuses Seyda Neen's CHIM frame map: six actors stand 0.8-3.3 units off the CHIM ground
- [CHIM-TERRAIN-GRAFT-33](CHIM-TERRAIN-GRAFT-33.md): CHIM chunk terrain is a brush entity, not part of the world tree, so it does not occlude
- [CHIM-TERRAIN-HULL-BEVELS-33](CHIM-TERRAIN-HULL-BEVELS-33.md): A standing box rests above the ground at convex CHIM terrain edges
- [CHIM-TEXTURE-SPECKS-33](CHIM-TEXTURE-SPECKS-33.md): CHIM-drawn surfaces show bright single-texel specks that legacy frames do not
- [CHIM-VALIDATOR-ORDER-33](CHIM-VALIDATOR-ORDER-33.md): The CHIM validator walk depended on Python string hashing
- [CHIM-VIEW-FACES-33](CHIM-VIEW-FACES-33.md): Model faces dominate each Balmora view: the streamer alone does not fix frame rate
- [CHIM-ZONE-RING-THRASH-33](CHIM-ZONE-RING-THRASH-33.md): Balmora's chunk ring does not fit the default 6 MiB CHIM zone, so the cache thrashes
- [CHIM-ZONE-TMP-NOEXEC-33](CHIM-ZONE-TMP-NOEXEC-33.md): The CHIM zone walk gate cannot load its host library when /tmp is mounted noexec
