## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed on the v0.0.34 NPC levels branch (not shipped).

## Symptom

The first development build with `--npc-lod on` reused its earlier stages and then stopped when
the area stage started: `TypeError: Object of type PosixPath is not JSON serializable` while the
scheduler wrote `build-state.json`.

## Where

`tools/build.py`, `npc_lod_arguments`: the extra arguments of the resident stages (area, Balmora,
Balmora interiors, imported towns) ended with `--npc-model-pool` and the asset-pool folder as a
`Path`. The other stage commands go through `tool()`, which turns every item into a string; these
arguments were appended after it.

## How it happened

The pool argument came from `media_file_cache`, which returns a `Path` for the folder; the media and
intro stages pass it through `tool()`, the resident stages did not.

## Why it was not caught

The tests checked the converter options and the option strings, not the full stage command with the
pool on a development version, and the gate does not run a build.

## Reproduction

Any `--stage aga` build of a `-devN` version with `--npc-lod on` (or any non-default NPC level option).

## Repair

`npc_lod_arguments` returns strings only.

## Verification

`tests/test_npc_lod.py` `test_stage_arguments_are_strings` fails without the repair (the pool folder
is a `Path`) and passes with it; the build resumed from its last completed stage.

## Prevention

The test builds the arguments of every resident stage on a development version and serializes them as
the scheduler does.
