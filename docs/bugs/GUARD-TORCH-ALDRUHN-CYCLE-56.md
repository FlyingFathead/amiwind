_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.57 (30 October 2026)._

## Status: 29 October 2026

Open. Found by the maintainer playing the v0.0.56-dev1 image on the Raspberry Pi 4 boot stick: "at least in ald'ruhn,
the guards aren't following the day/night cycle in using torches. next to the temple at least."

## Symptom

In Ald'ruhn the guards keep the same torch through the day and the night, beside the temple at least: they do not
light one at dusk and put it away at dawn as the guards of other towns do.

## Where

Ald'ruhn, the guards near the temple; other spots in Ald'ruhn not checked yet.

## How it happened

Partly known (30 October 2026). Not the guard list: the game data gives Ald'ruhn's outdoor guards (`redoran guard
male`, `redoran guard female`, class Guard) the same carried light as Balmora's Hlaalu guards, `torch_infinite_time`
(radius 256, carryable), so the build gives them the torch. Of the 62 class Guard records of Morrowind.esm placed
outdoors, all but 17 single guards (captains, sharpshooters, the census boat and dock guards) carry it; those 17 carry
no light in the original either.

One difference from the original's rule was found and repaired: the original puts the torches away while anything
falls, not only by day (rule from OpenMW files apps/openmw/mwworld/weather.cpp, `useTorches`: dark AND no
precipitation, where an ash or blight storm counts; apps/openmw/mwmechanics/actors.cpp, `updateEquippedLight`). The
engine followed the clock alone. Ald'ruhn lies in the Ashlands, where ash storms are frequent, so its guards are the
ones that differ most. What the maintainer saw by day (a torch kept in daylight) is not explained by this and is not
reproduced yet.

## Why it was not caught

The torch cycle's checks look at Seyda Neen and Balmora guards; no check covers Ald'ruhn.

## Reproduction

By the maintainer's account: in Ald'ruhn beside the temple, watch a guard across dusk and dawn.

## Repair

v0.0.57 (GUARD-TORCHES-57): the guards' torch rule is the original's, dark hours (before 06:00, after 20:00) with
nothing falling; `guards_torch_cycle 2` keeps the earlier rule (dark hours only), `0` turns the cycle off. The
guard torch light reaches as far as the original torch's (64 map units, `aw_guard_torch_radius` 0.33 of the
player torch's). The torch kept by day still needs a look in Ald'ruhn itself.

## Verification

None yet. In Ald'ruhn at 32 MB Fast: a guard beside the temple lights his torch at dusk and puts it away at dawn.

## Prevention

The cycle's check over every town's guards, not two towns.

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Lighting, lamps and night (`lighting-night`). Morrowind lights become Quake light entities baked by the light compiler and animated with lightstyles; night tables and dynamic lights follow the original. See [families](README.md#families).

- [ANIMKIT-TORCH-STANDING-35](ANIMKIT-TORCH-STANDING-35.md): With the animation kit, guards hold their torch only while standing; walking and running drop it
- [BALMORA-LAMPS-DIM-31](BALMORA-LAMPS-DIM-31.md): Balmora's street lamps are far too dim at night
- [CENSUS-OFFICE-BRIGHT-32](CENSUS-OFFICE-BRIGHT-32.md): The Census and Excise Office walls are about twice as bright as the original
- [CHIM-EXTERIOR-FLAMES-MISSING-48](CHIM-EXTERIOR-FLAMES-MISSING-48.md): CHIM exteriors draw no fire: campfires, braziers, fire pits and flame lamps outdoors have no flame animation
- [CHIM-MESHLESS-LIGHTS-33](CHIM-MESHLESS-LIGHTS-33.md): Exterior lights without a mesh have no CHIM light path: 2,284 placed lights give no light in a CHIM frame
- CHIM-ROOM-LIGHT-FLAT-48 (no report page): CHIM rooms light each placement at one level: Temple arch trims and Rithleen walls look flat and brighter than the room maps baked light
- [DLIGHT-WALLS-31](DLIGHT-WALLS-31.md): Torches barely light town walls at night
- [EMISSIVE-UNSHIPPED-31](EMISSIVE-UNSHIPPED-31.md): Glowing lantern glass never reached the shipped maps (only the Temple has it)
- ENGINE-FLAME-LIGHT-KEY-WARNING-51 (no report page): Every Seyda Neen load prints "aw_flame_light is not a field" ten times: the fire rows key no QuakeC field
- [FLAME-RANGE-NEAREST-32](FLAME-RANGE-NEAREST-32.md): A hearth fire shows only up close when many candles are nearer
- GUARD-COLD-28 (no report page): Night-guard torches not admitted on cold visits

- [INTERIOR-BAKE-UNIFORM-32](INTERIOR-BAKE-UNIFORM-32.md): Some interior bakes are uniform (lights possibly missing)
- INTERIOR-FOG-UNUSED-51 (no report page): Interiors have no fog: the cell's fog colour and density are never used, so misty caves and tinted rooms show none
- [INTERIOR-LIGHT-29](INTERIOR-LIGHT-29.md): Interiors lack convincing local illumination
- INTERIOR-NPC-LIGHT-29 (no report page): Census Office characters appear too dark under room lighting
- [INTERIOR-SUNLIGHT-COLOUR-51](INTERIOR-SUNLIGHT-COLOUR-51.md): The cell sunlight is baked as brightness only: Akulakhan's Chamber is lit grey where the original lights it red
- [INTERIOR-SUNLIGHT-UNBAKED-51](INTERIOR-SUNLIGHT-UNBAKED-51.md): Interiors are baked without their cell sunlight: Akulakhan's Chamber is nearly black where the original is lit red
- [LAMPS-FLICKER-31](LAMPS-FLICKER-31.md): Night lamps switch on and off while turning or walking
- [LAMPS-RANGE-31](LAMPS-RANGE-31.md): Only the nearest lamps light up at night
- [LIGHT-ENTITIES-UNWIRED-33](LIGHT-ENTITIES-UNWIRED-33.md): Morrowind lights are never turned into Quake light entities, so the light compiler bakes nothing

- SKY-MIDNIGHT-29 (no report page): Dense clouds still hide the midnight sky

- TORCH-LIGHT-29 (no report page): Torch flames look weak and provide little immediate light
