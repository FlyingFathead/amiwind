## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on the v0.0.35 line; ships with v0.0.35.

## Symptom

A screen update with several rectangles showed only the rows covered by the first one.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/vid_amiga.c VID_Update (native AGA path)`.

## How it happened

The native path converted rows 0 to the bottom of the first rectangle and ignored the rest of the list.

## Why it was not caught

The engine came from the original sources, where these paths assumed well-formed input; no test fed them bad or unusual values.

## Reproduction

Found by reading the source (v0.0.35 engine review).

## Repair

VID_Update walks the whole list and converts rows 0 to the lowest bottom edge, clamped to the screen height.

## Verification

Source check that VID_Update walks the rectangle list (tests/test_engine_review_native.py).

## Prevention

Untrusted input and unusual values are checked where they enter the engine; each fix has a regression check.
