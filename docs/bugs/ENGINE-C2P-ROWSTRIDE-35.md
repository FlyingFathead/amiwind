## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on the v0.0.35 line; ships with v0.0.35.

## Symptom

On a screen whose bitmap rows are padded for the display fetch mode (row length not equal to the width / 8), the picture would be drawn skewed.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/aw_c2p.c aw_c2p, vid_amiga.c VID_Init`.

## How it happened

The chunky-to-planar conversion wrote plane bytes one after another for the whole frame, as if every row were exactly width / 8 bytes long.

## Why it was not caught

The engine came from the original sources, where these paths assumed well-formed input; no test fed them bad or unusual values.

## Reproduction

Found by reading the source (v0.0.35 engine review).

## Repair

The conversion takes the width and row count and starts each plane row BytesPerRow bytes after the previous one, leaving padding untouched. VID_Init stops with a message when a screen buffer cannot hold a row (width not a multiple of 8, too few bytes per row or fewer than 8 planes).

## Verification

tests/test_aga.py checks the conversion against a pixel oracle for unpadded rows and two padded strides, including that padding bytes are untouched.

## Prevention

Untrusted input and unusual values are checked where they enter the engine; each fix has a regression check.
