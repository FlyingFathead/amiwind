## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on the v0.0.35 line; ships with v0.0.35.

## Symptom

Sys_FloatTime cost two 64-bit library divisions per call; the mixer and frame loop call it several times per frame.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/sys_amiga.c Sys_FloatTime, amiga_stubs.c timer`.

## How it happened

It called timer(), which split the 64-bit EClock count into seconds and microseconds, and then joined them again.

## Why it was not caught

The engine came from the original sources, where these paths assumed well-formed input; no test fed them bad or unusual values.

## Reproduction

Found by reading the source (v0.0.35 engine review).

## Repair

Once the timer is open, Sys_FloatTime reads the EClock, subtracts the first reading in 64-bit integer arithmetic and multiplies by the tick length (one FPU multiply). Before the timer opens the old path runs; the clock continues from its last value, and holds after the timer closes at shutdown.

## Verification

The tick arithmetic is extracted from the source and checked natively against a 64-bit reference, including low-word wrap (tests/test_engine_review_native.py).

## Prevention

Untrusted input and unusual values are checked where they enter the engine; each fix has a regression check.
