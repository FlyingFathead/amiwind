## Symptom

RC1 preflight rejects the new generated progress PNG; suite checks reject its missing totals label and stale contents lists.

## Where

RC1 public image exception, map totals label and document contents lists.

## How it happened

The map was added to the release allowlist without its individual gitignore exception. The refreshed table changed its required totals label. Journal and water-report additions left generated contents stale.

## Why it was not caught

These source changes were prepared before their combined exact-source gate could run. The first RC1 gate caught them before image assembly.

## Reproduction

Run the complete source suite and release-content preflight at commit `88aba74694d3512aeb03c85e6ae346e72381c03d`.

## Follow-up export failure, 13 October 2026

The checklist repair added BUILD-CHECKLIST-JSON-CELLS-39 and
RELEASE-PATCH-TARGET-VERSION-39 reports but omitted them from the public
source allowlist. Working-tree rendering passed; the exported-source suite
then failed because the two pages were absent. Add both exact report paths
and verify the exported source before running the full gate again.

## Repair

Add only the generated map image exception, restore the totals label without changing coverage counts, and regenerate affected document contents. Maintainer screenshots remain private.

## Verification

The failed gate is retained. The corrected exact-source rerun is pending; no package or native acceptance is inferred.

## Prevention

Keep preflight and the complete suite mandatory for the exact source. Changes to wrappers must preserve order and parameter checks; cache tests must demonstrate invalidation rather than assume internal unit names.

- [TRACKER-AREA-CELLS-RUN-WIDE-42](TRACKER-AREA-CELLS-RUN-WIDE-42.md): The CHIM tracker gives every area of a build all of the build's cells: Balmora holds 811 cells, so an area or shipped-towns plan selector takes most of the island
- [TRACKER-CHIM-COUNT-STALE-44](TRACKER-CHIM-COUNT-STALE-44.md): The CHIM progress tracker still reports 1,193 of 1,436 cells after a build with every exterior cell: it counts audits over both islands, not what the build put on CHIM
