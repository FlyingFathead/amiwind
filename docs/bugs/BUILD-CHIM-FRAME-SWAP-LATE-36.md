## Status: 11 October 2026

Open. PERSISTING, NOT RESOLVED. Found by the maintainer while reading the v0.0.36-dev3 build.


Repaired in source on v0.0.36-image-speed (not shipped; persisting until a build shows it): the world map manifest is made from the CHIM coverage before the first stage, and a collision check refuses the plan before any stage when a CHIM cell has a second maintainer (a cell claimed twice, an open-world stage whose work list would make the legacy map of a CHIM region cell, or a legacy map of a CHIM cell made with no recorded reason), listing the cells. World terrain, world scenery and world flora take the CHIM region cells (--chim-regions-cells) and make no map for them (world terrain keeps their directory rows); the image refuses a staged legacy map of such a cell, writes the cell's frame map from the game data, and the entity tracker counts the cell's CHIM placements. The Seyda Neen legacy chain stayed, recorded as "kept because" (source of its frame maps until Seyda Neen is CHIM-native); see below. Tests: tests/test_world_manifest.py (a mixed plan refused with its cells, a cell claimed twice, the legacy method kept with its reason, the builder giving the cells to every open-world stage, the stages making no map for a region cell).

Repaired in source on v0.0.36-seyda-chim (not shipped; persisting until a build shows it), maintainer order 11 October 2026
("we can't have that kind of a workflow, first builds it, then throws them away"): Seyda Neen is CHIM-native. A new
`chim-town-seyda` stage (`tools/chim_town.py` `prepare_seyda`) takes the town frame's and the two opening scenes' (intro
docks, Census courtyard) entities from the scene stage's complete converted town, by the same cut and flora rules and the
same code the legacy chain used, fits the residents on the CHIM frame's own collision and checks the statics against the
CHIM placements both ways. The actor-contact stage and the image step cut no Seyda Neen region map; the image stages no
Seyda Neen legacy map at all. Parity on the v0.0.36-dev3 run's files: the town frame's 243 entities, the docks' 56 and
the courtyard's 14 are identical to the legacy-chain frame maps (three fitted heights differ by 0.00001 unit), the
activated barrel's box is identical, 360 statics match both ways; the stage takes about 40 s. The world manifest's
"kept because: source of the town frame maps" exception is removed: a legacy chain of any CHIM area is refused before
the first stage unless a retired flag labels the build as an A/B regression test (`--legacy-area seyda` keeps the old
method selectable). Still built: the complete town map itself (the bsp stage, the scene chain's carrier of residents,
hands and intro entities); it is never staged or shipped, and moving it off a compiled map is a follow-up. Tests:
tests/test_seyda_chim_native.py, tests/test_world_manifest.py, tests/test_chim_no_legacy.py, tests/test_chim_town.py.

## Symptom

The v0.0.36-dev3 image step built 65 Seyda Neen legacy maps and 270 legacy open-world maps of cells that are already on CHIM (335 maps), converted, optimized and measured them like any other map, and removed them before packing (435,379,983 bytes removed; the 270 CHIM region cells had logged "194,704,856 legacy bytes out, 222,228 frame-map bytes in"). The image payload is correct. The cost is build time: for example about 12.6 % of the 5 min 22 s optimizer, and about 62 seconds for the Seyda chain.

## Where

The image step's removal of legacy maps of CHIM cells before packing, and every per-map stage that runs before it (conversion, optimizer, stats, staging). Related: BUILD-LEGACY-TOWN-MAPS-SHIPPED-36.

## How it happened

CHIM cells were added on top of the legacy chain. The legacy chain still builds every region map first, and a late step swaps the finished CHIM maps in.

## Why it was not caught

The final image was correct, so no check failed. No gate compares the work done per map with the maps that ship, and no phase reports how much of its work was thrown away.

## Reproduction

Build any v0.0.36 image with CHIM region cells and read the image step's "replaced in place" line, then compare it with the time spent on legacy maps in the stages before it.

## Persisting since

Persisting since CHIM-LEGACY-CHAIN-33 (v0.0.33-dev, 9 October 2026). The same problem as BUILD-LEGACY-TOWN-MAPS-SHIPPED-36: [CHIM-LEGACY-CHAIN-33](CHIM-LEGACY-CHAIN-33.md) (open), [BUILD-IMAGE-CHIM-NATIVE-TOWN-36](BUILD-IMAGE-CHIM-NATIVE-TOWN-36.md) (marked fixed, v0.0.36-dev1) and [BUILD-LEGACY-CHAIN-DEFAULT-36](BUILD-LEGACY-CHAIN-DEFAULT-36.md) (marked fixed, v0.0.36-dev3). They did not hold because each fixed one flag or one town, and none made the decision per map before the first stage. The two fixed entries now carry "persisting: still present in v0.0.36-dev3".

## Repair

Planned. One world map manifest decides, for every map, CHIM or legacy before the first stage. Every stage reads the manifest and skips maps that are on CHIM. Per-map work for the remaining maps goes into one hashed, parallel pool. The removal step becomes a check that must find 0 legacy maps of CHIM cells.

## Verification

To do: a build log with the manifest line, 0 legacy maps of CHIM cells processed, the check passing with nothing to remove, and the build time before and after. An earlier version of this page counted the removed bytes as payload that shipped; that was wrong.

## Prevention

The image-step check fails the build if it finds any legacy map of a CHIM cell. A profile gate reports work done for maps that do not ship.

- [BUILD-STAIR-WALK-SLOW-33](BUILD-STAIR-WALK-SLOW-33.md): The image step's stair walk spent most of its time in interpreted collision traces and brute-force headroom tests (1,751 s of the rc1c image step)
- [BUILD-STATS-SERIAL-36](BUILD-STATS-SERIAL-36.md): The CHIM stats step runs serially and silently on one core
- [BUILD-STORAGE-DUPLICATES-33](BUILD-STORAGE-DUPLICATES-33.md): Build storage keeps full duplicate copies of images, stage outputs and packages, and nothing removes them
- [BUILD-UNDERUSE-GATE-36](BUILD-UNDERUSE-GATE-36.md): The profiler did not flag long underused phases: 7 min 44 s of CHIM statistics on 1 of 24 cores and 77 s of zone walk on 1 core showed nowhere
- [BUILD-WINDOWS-DOCKER-SLOW-31](BUILD-WINDOWS-DOCKER-SLOW-31.md): Docker builds and disk-image steps on Windows folders are slow
- [CHIM-BUDGET-RERUN-SERIAL-48](CHIM-BUDGET-RERUN-SERIAL-48.md): When one CHIM unit is over the brush image budget, every unit of its kind runs again one by one on one core to name it
- [CHIM-EMPTY-MODEL-REPORT-40](CHIM-EMPTY-MODEL-REPORT-40.md): Terrain-only CHIM validation crashes while reporting the largest scenery model
- [CHIM-INTERIORS-UNDERUSED-48](CHIM-INTERIORS-UNDERUSED-48.md): The CHIM interiors stage ran at 8.6 of 24 cores for 1 min 11 s
- [CHIM-LEGACY-CHAIN-33](CHIM-LEGACY-CHAIN-33.md): CHIM builds still run the legacy exterior chain: frame maps read the legacy region maps, and the open world is built
- [CHIM-PVS-SLOW-33](CHIM-PVS-SLOW-33.md): Seyda Neen's CHIM visibility rows take 5.5 minutes and are rebuilt whenever the worker count changes
- [CHIM-ROOM-FAIL-STAGE-48](CHIM-ROOM-FAIL-STAGE-48.md): One CHIM room that cannot be made failed the whole CHIM interiors stage (HOLD-LEVEL with every room batch by default)
- [CHIM-ROOM-OVER-BUDGET-RETRY-48](CHIM-ROOM-OVER-BUDGET-RETRY-48.md): A model over the image budget is tried whole again on every run before its cached tiles are used: its room runs on one core
- [CHIM-STAIR-GATE-WORLD-RELOAD-36](CHIM-STAIR-GATE-WORLD-RELOAD-36.md): The CHIM stair gate's workers read the whole CHIM world again every time they switch frames (about 14.5 s per read on the 273-frame world)
- [CHIM-STAIRGATE-SLOW-33](CHIM-STAIRGATE-SLOW-33.md): The CHIM stair gate takes over 10 minutes on the Balmora and Vivec Arena world
- [HARVEST-CHIM-COVERAGE-ONE-AREA-48](HARVEST-CHIM-COVERAGE-ONE-AREA-48.md): The image step harvest coverage check failed on every CHIM world of one area (every MiniWind sandbox of one town)
- [MINIWIND-NO-INTERIOR-SCOPE-42](MINIWIND-NO-INTERIOR-SCOPE-42.md): A MiniWind of one room built the whole town: no scope converted only the start room
- [MINIWIND-NOT-MINUTES-33](MINIWIND-NOT-MINUTES-33.md): A reused MiniWind build took about two hours instead of minutes
- [MINIWIND-SCENE-CHAIN-WEIGHT-42](MINIWIND-SCENE-CHAIN-WEIGHT-42.md): Every MiniWind bakes all playable races and the opening rooms, and walks its whole frame stairs
- [NPC-BAKED-WHOLE-DUPLICATION-33](NPC-BAKED-WHOLE-DUPLICATION-33.md): Every NPC appearance is baked whole: shared body parts are converted again for each actor, and equipment cannot change
- [ROOM-BAKE-FOOTPRINT-SLOW-48](ROOM-BAKE-FOOTPRINT-SLOW-48.md): The room actor bake's footprint rule with the collision-box test is more than 100 times slower
- [ROOM-BATCH-CORES-49](ROOM-BATCH-CORES-49.md): The room batches stage ran on about two of its eight cores for minutes before its first room, and kept few of its finished rooms when stopped
- ROOM-RESIDENTS-KEY-SERIAL-49 (no report page): The room residents step opens its unit cache once per resident: 233 s on one core before any cached resident is restored

- [BUILD-LEGACY-CHAIN-DEFAULT-36](BUILD-LEGACY-CHAIN-DEFAULT-36.md): Builds still prepared CHIM towns through the legacy region-map chain by default, and a retired flag (--legacy-area) was accepted with only a warning
- [BUILD-LEGACY-TOWN-MAPS-SHIPPED-36](BUILD-LEGACY-TOWN-MAPS-SHIPPED-36.md): CHIM-native Seyda Neen is still built through the legacy chain: 65 sn maps are built and removed before packing (build time, not payload)
