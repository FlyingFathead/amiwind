## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed in source on the v0.0.33 stage-parallel branch, not shipped. Present in the v0.0.32 builder.

## Symptom

A stage's pool workers inherited the scheduler's allowance file. A worker that asked for a
one-worker map (`ordered_map(f, items, 1)`, as every room and town interior worker does for its
models and placements) got a pool that followed the stage allowance instead: with twelve room
workers, each could start up to twelve more processes. In the v0.0.32 from-scratch build
(`--jobs 24`) balmora-interiors held 12 workers and ran at 15.7-16.9 cores for its first two
minutes (137 seconds above its allowance), taking the cores the NPC gallery (on the critical path)
was given; every room also paid the start-up of its own spawn pool.

## Where

`tools/build_parallel.py`: `_throttle` treats an uncapped pool under the allowance environment as
the stage's pool; spawn workers inherited that environment from the stage process.

## How it happened

The allowance (BUILD-SCHEDULER-JOBSHARE-32) was meant for the stage process: a stage that started
with one worker grows when workers free up. Nested pools inside workers were not considered.

## Why it was not caught

The profiler compared cores with the start value (BUILD-PROFILE-JOBS-START-ONLY-33); against one
worker, 16 cores did not look like an overrun. No test opened a pool inside a pool worker under
the scheduler.

## Reproduction

`balmora-interiors` timeline in `build-profile.json` against its `worker_changes` (12 held,
about 16 used), or any `ordered_map(f, items, 1)` inside a pool worker of a scheduled stage.

## Repair

Pool workers start with an initializer that removes the allowance and budget variables: a worker's
own pools keep the size the caller asked for (one stays serial, an explicit share stays that
share), so outer x inner stays within the stage's workers. The stage process itself still follows
its allowance.

## Verification

`tests/test_build_parallel.py` `test_pool_workers_do_not_follow_the_stage_allowance`: under an
allowance of 3, the workers see no allowance, a nested one-worker map runs in the worker itself,
and the stage pool still uses more than one worker. Pool sizes do not change results (ordered
maps, byte-identical outputs: stage-only runs in [BUILD-IDLE-STAGES-33](BUILD-IDLE-STAGES-33.md)).

## Prevention

The test above.
