_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.59-dev6 (3 November 2026)._

## Status: 3 November 2026

Fixed in v0.0.59-dev6. The container strip and the item pickup no longer search any island-wide file in play.

## Symptom

In Arrille's Tradehouse, opening a container or taking an item held the game for seconds; one frame could last about 10 seconds.

## Where

The searches of the island-wide item, focus and picture files during play.

## How it happened

Each step of a search refilled a 16 KiB file buffer, so a search over a large file cost many refills on the emulated
disk.

## Why it was not caught

The time of the strip's and the pickup's file searches was not measured on the emulator before this report.

## Reproduction

In Arrille's Tradehouse, open the strip on a container and take an item; read the frame lines the console prints.

## Repair

First the buffers of those searches were made smaller (a take took under 100 ms and the strip open about 0.8 s). Then
the per-area lookup tables (id1/areas.awa) replaced the searches: containers, owners, item records and strip pictures
come from a table loaded with the area.

## Verification

On FS-UAE at 32 MB Fast in Arrille's Tradehouse the strip open takes 1 ms and a take 0 ms, and the session made no file
search at all.

## Prevention

The frame wait counters on the long frame lines show the time spent in file calls.
