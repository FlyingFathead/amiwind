_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.48-dev2 (23 October 2026)._

## Status: 23 October 2026

Fixed in v0.0.48-dev2 (branch v0.0.48-room-grounding), by rule rather than by a class per NPC: every NPC and
creature reference of every room of the list is classified per reference from the game data, by the maintainer's rule
of 22 October 2026 (actors start where the game puts them; see
[room residents by rule](../NPC_GROUND_CONTACT.md#room-residents-by-rule)). `tools/actor_grounding_census.py --rooms`
measures the feet against the room's own floor (its placements' visible and collision triangles) and writes
`config/actor_grounding_rooms.json`; `tools/actor_grounding.py` reads it by reference number for an actor the policy
does not name. 1,134 rooms, 3,007 references: 2,819 on the floor, 143 authored dead, 45 kept off the floor (43
swimming or flying creatures and two NPCs, listed with their heights), none without a floor; 1,270 levelled lists
deferred. Measured in the stage on every batch: no batch is refused for grounding any more (Ald-ruhn's first batch,
refused before for 62 NPCs, converts its 28 rooms). Not yet seen in a build or in the game.

## Symptom

`--room-batches 5` (Ald-ruhn, part 1): the room batches stage converted the 27 rooms (56 s on 5.6 of 8 cores), then
stopped in the residents step: `Unclassified initial support state: tuundir`. The fail-fast check added on the branch
now lists the whole gap in 4 s: 62 resident NPCs in 22 of the 27 rooms.

## Where

`config/actor_grounding.json`, `tools/actor_grounding.py` `initial_state`, and the residents step
(`prepare_area.populate`).

## How it happened

The grounding policy (CHIM-ACTOR-GROUNDING-POLICY-36) is an explicit list: every placed NPC is either standing on the
ground or a documented exception, and nothing is guessed. `tools/actor_grounding_census.py` fills the list by measuring
the exterior placements. Interior NPCs were added room by room when a town listed its rooms (the Arena Waistworks
precedent, be71cd90). Rooms by batch bring in hundreds of rooms no town lists, and their residents were never measured.

## What was done

Not a hand-made class per NPC (the plan above this fix): the rule the region frames use
(`tools/chim/region_actors.py`), per reference. Classes: `floor` (ordinary contact), `off_floor` and `no_floor`
(kept at the authored spot, `aw_ground_mode 1`, listed with the script), `authored_dead`. The tolerance is the
exterior census's (32 game units up, 128 down: the fitter's reach and `AW_NPCFloor`). The policy keeps its word for the
ids it names; one conflict is listed to check (a Hlaalu guard in Caldera Mine, 177 units above its floor, policy
ground).

## Verification

`tests/test_room_grounding.py` (synthetic rooms: standing, sitting on a chair, authored high with a script, no floor,
authored dead; the file holds no positions; lookup only by reference; the preflight passes with the file and still
refuses an actor neither names), `tests/test_room_batches.py` `GroundingPreflight`. In the stage on all 40 batches:
no grounding refusal.

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Content silently missing from a build (`build-content-missing`). Every omission is receipted; payload and entity counts are compared with the last release; shipped features are on by default. See [families](README.md#families).
