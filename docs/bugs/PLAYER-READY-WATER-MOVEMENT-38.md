## Symptom

The owner reports that weapon-unsheathed or torch-out mode effectively allows
walking on water. Expected swimming transitions need checking against original
Morrowind/OpenMW; legitimate Water Walking effects must remain a separate override.

## Where

Player water entry, movement and ready/equipment state in v0.0.38-dev2.

## How it happened

Cause unknown. Inspect AmiQuake SV_CheckWater and movement/physics first, then
the player equipment and spell-state integration. Do not infer that the visual
holding pose alone proves the player is standing on the surface.

## Why it was not caught

No exact-package water-entry test matrix for sheathed, readied and torch-out
states with and without an active Water Walking effect is attached.

## Reproduction

Enter sufficiently deep water unarmed, with fists raised, with a weapon drawn,
and with a torch out. Record position, waterlevel, movement type and spell state.
Compare against matched original/OpenMW conditions. Owner report only so far;
exact location, spell state and independent reproduction remain unknown.

## Repair

Pending diagnosis. Follow original swimming and equipment restrictions while
preserving explicit Water Walking effects. Reuse existing movement machinery.

## Verification

Open, needs fixing. No native reproduction, original comparison or repair yet.

## Prevention

Exercise both entering and leaving deep water for every ready/equipment state,
including valid Water Walking, effect expiry and save/load transitions.
