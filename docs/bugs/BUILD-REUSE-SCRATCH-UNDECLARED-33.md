## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.33-reuse-scratch, not shipped at the time of writing.

Provenance: found reading the stage-cache records of the v0.0.33-rc1 builds rc1b (source 27058ec) and rc1c
(source a266a40, built with `--reuse-from` rc1b and `--allow-release-reuse`).

## Symptom

rc1c was a rerun of rc1b after a one-file fix in the image step. Its build state listed one reused stage
(setup) and "old outputs not reusable: created run-folder entries outside every declared stage path: scratch"
for terrain, dialogue-lookup, world-survey, world-scenery-assets and music. Every stage after them was then
refused because "an earlier stage it depends on ran again and its outputs differ from the old run". The whole
conversion ran again: about 1,427 s before the image step started.

## Where

`tools/build_cache.py`: `RUN_PRIVATE` (run-folder entries that belong to no stage) and `Recorder.after`,
which marks a stage non-reusable when a new top-level run-folder entry belongs to no declared stage path.

## How it happened

BUILD-TMP-SCRATCH-33 gave every stage the scratch folder RUN/scratch (`build_scratch.stage_environment`).
It is created by the first stage that needs scratch space, so it appears in the window of every stage running
at that moment; the recorder counted it as their undeclared output. Those stages were recorded non-reusable,
and a later build cannot use them or prove that a rerun made the same outputs (BUILD-CACHE-NO-CUTOFF-33),
so every dependent stage ran again too. The outputs themselves were identical: terrain 8 of 8 files, music
19 of 19 and media 7,185 of 7,185 match between rc1b and rc1c.

## Why it was not caught

The scratch helper and the reuse recorder were tested apart: no test started a stage with the builder's
stage environment and then checked its manifest. The reuse tests ran without RUN/scratch, and the rc builds'
reuse counts were not compared with the expected stage list.

## Reproduction

Build once, then build again with `--reuse-from` that run: the stages that ran when RUN/scratch first
appeared are listed as not reusable, and every stage after them runs again.

## Repair

RUN/scratch is run-private (`RUN_PRIVATE`). Records written by the old code are read through
`build_cache.requalify`: a manifest whose only reason not to be reused is exactly the scratch entry is
reusable again; its fingerprint and the same-output checks apply as for any other stage, and any other
reason still refuses reuse. Read against the real records: rc1b 33 of 33 conversion stages reusable (7
requalified), rc1c 33 of 33 (2 requalified); the image step is always assembled again.

## Verification

`test_the_builder_scratch_folder_is_not_an_undeclared_output` (fails without the repair) and
`test_old_records_refused_only_for_scratch_are_reusable` in tests/test_build_cache.py.

Measured on the v0.0.33 release builds (`--reuse-from`, same workspace): before the repair the release
candidate reruns reused 17, 18 and 25 of 34 stages, and every conversion stage that ran after the scratch
folder appeared was refused even when its outputs were byte-identical. A read-only re-check of those records
with the repaired loader finds all 33 conversion stages reusable. The v0.0.33 final image, built with the
repair from the last release candidate, reused 30 of 34 stages; the four that ran: `engine` (compiled with
the Amiga SDK, whose files are not fingerprinted, about 15 s), `harvest` and `chim` (their sources include
`tools/release-files.json` and `VERSION`, which the version change touches) and `image` (always assembled
and verified from the stage outputs).

## Prevention

The first test takes the scratch folder's name from `build_scratch.stage_environment` itself, so a moved or
renamed scratch folder fails it. A related open finding: BUILD-SURVEY-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33.

## Persisting

The same class of problem, needless rebuilds from keys that cover more than the inputs, is still present in v0.0.36-dev3: [BUILD-OPTIMIZER-CACHE-KEY-BROAD-36](BUILD-OPTIMIZER-CACHE-KEY-BROAD-36.md) (13 of 2,658 maps reused). This entry's own repair held; the class persisted.

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Build reuse keys and output attribution (`build-cache-reuse`). A unit is rebuilt only when the content hash of all its inputs changes or its output is missing or damaged. Keys never under-declare (a missed input allows a wrong reuse) and should not over-declare (a file no output depends on forces rebuilds); outputs carry no wall-clock values; every changed file is credited to the stage that wrote it. See [families](README.md#families).

- [BUILD-ACTOR-LIBRARY-MWAD-PATH-47](BUILD-ACTOR-LIBRARY-MWAD-PATH-47.md): The actor-library stage stopped at once: run as a script, tools/mwad.py hid the src/mwad package
- [BUILD-CACHE-OWNER-FAILS-STAGE-34](BUILD-CACHE-OWNER-FAILS-STAGE-34.md): A cache entry owned by another user failed a release build four minutes in, instead of being rebuilt or caught before any stage
- [BUILD-CACHE-PROVENANCE-41](BUILD-CACHE-PROVENANCE-41.md): Some cache entries record no time or no versions: pool keys from CHIMport have empty versions and commit, world-terrain units and stage records have no creation time or version
- BUILD-CACHE-PROVENANCE-GROWTH-54 (no report page): chim-units/.provenance is one append-only 8.8 GB file; its growth per build is not measured
- BUILD-CELL-PROGRESS-ENGINE-KEY-48 (no report page): The tracker data stage (cell-progress) counted every engine source in its key: an engine-only edit rebuilt it
- [BUILD-CELL-PROGRESS-KEY-BUGS-35](BUILD-CELL-PROGRESS-KEY-BUGS-35.md): Every bug registration stopped builds at the reuse preflight: the cell-progress key held all of docs/
- BUILD-CHIM-KEY-ENGINE-FILE-WHOLE-54 (no report page): chim_world.c is keyed whole into the CHIM world, so a diagnostic print re-keys the world
- BUILD-CHIM-KEY-ENGINE-SOURCES-49 (no report page): An engine source edit rebuilds the whole CHIM world: the CHIM stage imports project_version, whose engine check names engine/aga/src files
- [BUILD-CHIM-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-35](BUILD-CHIM-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-35.md): The CHIM stage's fingerprint left out the tracker code it ran (8 files, 2 functions): a wrong-reuse risk
- [BUILD-CHIM-KEY-VERSION-48](BUILD-CHIM-KEY-VERSION-48.md): The CHIM world and cell-progress stages key on VERSION, so a version-only bump (rc to final) rebuilds the whole CHIM world
- [BUILD-CHIM-LABEL-IN-KEYS-48](BUILD-CHIM-LABEL-IN-KEYS-48.md): The CHIM version label was in the stage keys: the x.x.1 release step rebuilt about 25 stages, the CHIM world among them
- BUILD-CHIM-RECORD-COMPILER-INCOMPLETE-51 (no report page): The chim stage's read record is always incomplete: it starts compilers with checkout paths, so it can never be reused when only its key's sources changed
- BUILD-CHIM-VIS-RECOMPUTED-48 (no report page): The CHIM stage recomputed every region frame's visibility (1 h 20 min on 24 cores)
- [BUILD-CUTOFF-WHOLE-ANCESTOR-51](BUILD-CUTOFF-WHOLE-ANCESTOR-51.md): An interior light change reran exterior stages: the reuse cutoff refuses a stage when any earlier stage's whole output differs, not the files it reads
- BUILD-DEV-GALLERY-SKIP-RC-REBUILD-48 (no report page): Development builds leave out the NPC gallery, so every release candidate builds all 3,551 faces fresh
- [BUILD-DIAGNOSTIC-INPUT-REFUSED-36](BUILD-DIAGNOSTIC-INPUT-REFUSED-36.md): The cell-progress stage was never reusable: it reads the CHIM stage's statistics report, which counted as a forbidden diagnostic read
- [BUILD-ENGINE-KEY-SDK-33](BUILD-ENGINE-KEY-SDK-33.md): The engine stage is never reused: the Amiga SDK is not part of its key
- [BUILD-FLORA-RECEIPT-SECONDS-36](BUILD-FLORA-RECEIPT-SECONDS-36.md): The world flora receipt held the stage's wall time, so a rerun with the same inputs never wrote the same receipt
- [BUILD-GALLERY-JSON-KEY-ORDER-35](BUILD-GALLERY-JSON-KEY-ORDER-35.md): NPC gallery outputs differed between two builds only in JSON key order (cache vs fresh results)
- [BUILD-IMAGE-LAYOUT-SERIAL-49](BUILD-IMAGE-LAYOUT-SERIAL-49.md): The image step plans its disk layout and writes its partitions on about 1.6 of 24 cores for about three minutes
- [BUILD-IMAGE-NO-RESUME-33](BUILD-IMAGE-NO-RESUME-33.md): A late failure in the image step reruns the whole image step, and the failing check could have run in its first seconds
- [BUILD-IMAGE-STALE-PYTHONPATH-35](BUILD-IMAGE-STALE-PYTHONPATH-35.md): Builder container images put an old builder copy on PYTHONPATH
- [BUILD-KEY-FUNCTION-DEFAULTS-TOP-36](BUILD-KEY-FUNCTION-DEFAULTS-TOP-36.md): Adding a function to a shared module changed the key of every stage that imports it, although no stage runs the new code
- BUILD-KEY-KEYED-REACH-WHOLE-51 (no report page): Code handed to an in-stage cache key counted whole in the stage key: a helper added to tools/map_files.py rebuilt the CHIM world
- BUILD-KEY-MESH-TABLE-WHOLE-54 (no report page): A per-mesh measured table is keyed whole: one new row of collision-standing-room.json re-keyed every room, resident and model unit
- [BUILD-KEY-OVERBROAD-33](BUILD-KEY-OVERBROAD-33.md): A new bug page or release file list change rebuilds interior, census, harvest and the CHIM stages: an import search path counted as a read of every file under tools/
- BUILD-KEY-RULE-NO-FORM-51 (no report page): A change of the stage key rules without a new key form rebuilt stages whose inputs did not change
- BUILD-KEY-UNIT-RESTORED-CODE-52 (no report page): A stage whose last real run restored its units from a cache was reused after the code those units come from changed: chim-room-batches kept actor models of the old animation tables
- BUILD-MINIWIND-REUSE-STALE-57 (no report page): The MiniWind build launcher reused the v0.0.53 final run instead of the newest passed run
- BUILD-MWSCRIPT-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-48 (no report page): The mwscript stage's reuse record is refused: the stage reads tools/mwscript/measure.py, which its fingerprint leaves out
- [BUILD-NPC-BAKE-CACHE-KEY-40](BUILD-NPC-BAKE-CACHE-KEY-40.md): New NPC shell fallback dependencies are absent from the model cache key
- [BUILD-OUTPUTS-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33](BUILD-OUTPUTS-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33.md): A stage that runs again never matches its old outputs (tool logs, timings, run paths), so every stage after it is rebuilt
- [BUILD-PASS-KEY-OVERBROAD-36](BUILD-PASS-KEY-OVERBROAD-36.md): Image-pass and unit cache keys changed with code no pass runs: a new function in a shared module and edits to the cache's own key code rekeyed every character head preview twice (Vivec stage A try2 and try3: 275 of 275 recomputed)
- [BUILD-PASS-KEY-RULE-NO-CARRYOVER-36](BUILD-PASS-KEY-RULE-NO-CARRYOVER-36.md): A pass key rule change carried no entries written by older trees: dev4 recomputed 2,372 optimizer maps and the exterior sky maps with code and outputs identical to dev3
- [BUILD-POOL-APPLY-READ-MISS-35](BUILD-POOL-APPLY-READ-MISS-35.md): In a pool-mode build every reused stage was refused as the next reuse source: the reuse step's read of tools/storage_pool.py counted as a stage input
- [BUILD-POOL-ARG-UNFINGERPRINTED-35](BUILD-POOL-ARG-UNFINGERPRINTED-35.md): The balmora stage was never reusable once the shared storage pool grew past 512 MiB: its --npc-model-pool folder was hashed as an input
- [BUILD-POOL-READONLY-SCENE-WRITE-35](BUILD-POOL-READONLY-SCENE-WRITE-35.md): A pool-mode resume failed in 17 s: npcs could not rewrite its copy of seyda.bsp (copytree kept the pool's read-only mode)
- BUILD-PREFLIGHT-CELL-PROGRESS-VERSION-49 (no report page): The reuse preflight calls the tracker data stage (cell-progress) an unexpected VERSION-only rebuild, though its outputs name the release derived from VERSION
- [BUILD-RESUME-HAZARD-STATIC-35](BUILD-RESUME-HAZARD-STATIC-35.md): A resume failed in 'area': the rebuild hazard counted files of a reused stage that had run again after all
- [BUILD-RESUME-OUTPUTS-DIFFER-35](BUILD-RESUME-OUTPUTS-DIFFER-35.md): Every v0.0.35 resume refused the stages after a rerun scene-chain stage as 'outputs differ' without comparing them
- BUILD-REUSE-APPLY-SERIAL-49 (no report page): Reusing a stage links its cached files on about one core: 34,306 files took 1.4 minutes at the start of a version-only build
- [BUILD-REUSE-ATTRIBUTION-33](BUILD-REUSE-ATTRIBUTION-33.md): Two stages that ran at the same time were both refused reuse when one wrote files under a folder the other only reads
- [BUILD-REUSE-AUDIT-WITHOUT-REASON-36](BUILD-REUSE-AUDIT-WITHOUT-REASON-36.md): The reuse audit and preflight called a stage rerun because its old record was short a replaced file UNEXPECTED, although the reason explains it
- [BUILD-REUSE-CASCADE-36](BUILD-REUSE-CASCADE-36.md): A fix in CHIM-native town code made 23 of 36 stages rebuild: the interior stage reran with different outputs and 5 rebuilds were unexpected
- [BUILD-REUSE-CUTOFF-MODE-36](BUILD-REUSE-CUTOFF-MODE-36.md): Early cutoff compared file modes with their write bits: a stage reused by hard link (read-only) never matched the same bytes written fresh, so 10 stages after dev3's bsp rerun were refused
- BUILD-REUSE-FOREIGN-DIRS-52 (no report page): A reused stage recreates, as empty folders, the folders another stage filled beside it: the area stage then stops on its own room folder
- [BUILD-REUSE-INTRO-CENSUS-REPLACED-48](BUILD-REUSE-INTRO-CENSUS-REPLACED-48.md): A reused MiniWind rooms build rebuilt the intro and census stages (replaced outputs) and its Balmora interiors (4 s to 1m21s)
- BUILD-REUSE-KEY-WALK-LISTED-51 (no report page): The read records of the CHIM world stages list almost every folder of the checkout, so a new bug page refuses their narrowed reuse
- BUILD-REUSE-OUTPUTS-DIFFER-48 (no report page): Eight stages were rebuilt because their earlier outputs differed from their records (character, reading, world-ui, actor-contact, world-terrain and others)
- [BUILD-REUSE-PLAN-ENV-36](BUILD-REUSE-PLAN-ENV-36.md): The standalone reuse plan reports environment changes the real build does not have
- BUILD-REUSE-RC1-RECORDS-REFUSED-48 (no report page): Every stage that ran the idle-worker watcher or read the CHIM label module was marked not reusable: rc1-try2 had 24 unexpected rebuilds
- [BUILD-REUSE-RECORD-RETIRED-36](BUILD-REUSE-RECORD-RETIRED-36.md): Early cutoff and the reuse audit lost their records when an older run was retired: stages with byte-identical outputs counted as changed
- [BUILD-REUSE-REDUCED-RECORD-36](BUILD-REUSE-REDUCED-RECORD-36.md): A stage reused from a run that had itself reused it came back without the files a later stage replaced there, so that later stage failed when it ran again
- [BUILD-REUSE-SCHEDULER-TOP-45](BUILD-REUSE-SCHEDULER-TOP-45.md): A scheduler-only edit rekeys every stage, NPC gallery face and stair walk that reaches tools/build_parallel.py
- BUILD-REUSE-STOPPED-SOURCE-52 (no report page): Reusing a build that stopped early reruns every stage it never reached, though the build it reused holds them
- [BUILD-REUSE-TMP-RECORDED-DELETED-48](BUILD-REUSE-TMP-RECORDED-DELETED-48.md): A reused stage removed another stage's reuse copies mid-copy: its record listed them as deleted (balmora-interiors stopped at os.replace)
- BUILD-ROOM-BATCHES-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-48 (no report page): The room stage's reuse record is refused: it reads 17 repository files its fingerprint leaves out
- BUILD-ROOM-BATCHES-SCENE-RACE-48 (no report page): A reused build stopped in the room stage: it ran before the area stage had restored the scene map it reads (seyda.bsp)
- [BUILD-SCENE-DIAGNOSTIC-COPY-35](BUILD-SCENE-DIAGNOSTIC-COPY-35.md): Scene-chain stages were never reusable: copying the previous scene (logs included) counted as reading another stage's diagnostics
- [BUILD-SCHEDULER-TABLE-KEY-35](BUILD-SCHEDULER-TABLE-KEY-35.md): A new row in the build scheduler's stage table rebuilds stages that never read it: the table counted as import-time code of every stage
- [BUILD-SEYDA-BOUNDED-RUN-PATHS-36](BUILD-SEYDA-BOUNDED-RUN-PATHS-36.md): The actor-contact stage wrote its run folder path into 67 Seyda Neen region records, so its outputs differed in every run folder
- BUILD-SHARED-WRITES-UNATTRIBUTED-52 (no report page): Stages running side by side write the same files, so their records are refused and they rebuild every time: the town carried-item models, the room door audio
- [BUILD-SPRITE-KEY-HASHLIB-47](BUILD-SPRITE-KEY-HASHLIB-47.md): The CHIM stage failed 45 minutes into a build: the sprite recipe key used hashlib without importing it
- BUILD-STAGE-KEY-WHOLE-CLASS-48 (no report page): A one-method edit in tools/actor_grounding.py rekeyed the CHIM stages: a class was import-time code of its module, so every stage importing the module hashed every method
- [BUILD-STAGE-READS-UNFINGERPRINTED-48](BUILD-STAGE-READS-UNFINGERPRINTED-48.md): Two stages read repository files their fingerprint leaves out, so their records are refused and they rerun on every reuse
- [BUILD-STAIR-KEY-BOOKKEEPING-36](BUILD-STAIR-KEY-BOOKKEEPING-36.md): Stair walk keys count the progress lines (stair_progress.py) and the record bookkeeping (stair_records.py): an edit to either rekeys every walk
- [BUILD-STAIR-PASS-NOT-KEPT-41](BUILD-STAIR-PASS-NOT-KEPT-41.md): A frame's passed stair walk is not reused when the build it ran in failed, and the walker key changes with converter code
- [BUILD-SURVEY-KEY-CONFIG-35](BUILD-SURVEY-KEY-CONFIG-35.md): World survey, world terrain, world UI and CHIM stage keys counted every file under config/: a path built from a loop name read as the whole folder
- [BUILD-SURVEY-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33](BUILD-SURVEY-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33.md): The world-survey stage writes its wall time into its outputs, so a rerun never has the same outputs
- [BUILD-VERSION-GETATTR-TRACE-49](BUILD-VERSION-GETATTR-TRACE-49.md): The v0.0.49 final rebuilt the CHIM world: the lazy VERSION (a module __getattr__ in project_version) ran in the CHIM stage, its read trace recorded it and the key could not
- [CACHE-NO-PROVENANCE-36](CACHE-NO-PROVENANCE-36.md): Cache and pool entries were keyed by SHA-256 but did not record when, by which run, from which version and commit they were made, and some recorded no output hash
- CHIM-COLLISION-UNION-FAIL-NOT-CACHED-48 (no report page): A collision union that fails is compiled again for every room that uses the same mesh packet
- [CHIM-INTERIORS-REUSE-MISS-48](CHIM-INTERIORS-REUSE-MISS-48.md): The CHIM rooms stage (chim-interiors) is never reused: it hashed the shared CHIM unit cache, which is past the 512 MiB folder limit
- [CHIMPORT-NO-SHARED-POOL-35](CHIMPORT-NO-SHARED-POOL-35.md): The CHIMporter kept its own unit store beside the shared hashed storage pool: no pool flag, every run folder a private copy
- [CHIMPORT-POOL-CROSS-MOUNT-36](CHIMPORT-POOL-CROSS-MOUNT-36.md): CHIMport run folder and the storage pool on two mounts of one volume: hard links fail across the mounts, so pooled units were copied, not linked
- [CHIMPORT-RETRY-AUDIT-FAILED-36](CHIMPORT-RETRY-AUDIT-FAILED-36.md): CHIMport --retry-failed never reran cells that converted but failed an audit (memory fit, doors, hull chains): the runner marks them done
- DOOR-CHECK-KNOWN-UNKEYED-54 (no report page): config/door-check-known.json is in no stage key: an edit to the known list never re-runs a passed image's door check
- [MWAD-WALK-ORDER-35](MWAD-WALK-ORDER-35.md): Input check results depend on directory listing order
