_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.43-dev3 (18 October 2026)._

## Symptom

The maintainer reported missing objects, including Dwemer ruins, in the v0.0.36 CHIM coast. The roadmap previously named this issue without a canonical report page or register row. This report preserves the original ID.

## Where

Coastal CHIM regions. Exact cell coordinates, reference IDs and package identity still need reproduction evidence.

## How it happened

Unknown. Investigate source placements, conversion exclusions, region assignment, shared model payload, runtime loading and visibility separately. Missing objects must not be inferred solely from an aggregate conversion percentage.

## Why it was not caught

Existing terrain and format checks establish neither complete object placement nor runtime visibility. The absence of a canonical report also left the investigation without explicit reproduction evidence.

## Reproduction

The maintainer reported the issue on 11 October 2026 with v0.0.36. Identify a missing object from the original data, bind its cell and reference ID, and compare matching original-game and converted-game poses. Repeat on the exact candidate image.

## Repair

Pending diagnosis. Preserve correct placements and existing shared-model reuse; do not bypass limits or mark deferred references as present.

## Verification

No independently reproduced location or native repair is established. The source-placement inventory and matched gameplay comparison are pending. This report does not claim the whole coast is missing or that an aggregate figure proves a specific omission.

## Prevention

Record per-cell source references with explicit converted, deferred, skipped and failed reasons, then verify representative authored structures in game. Inspect existing AmiQuake entity linking and visibility machinery before proposing an engine change.
