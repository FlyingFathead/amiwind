15 October 2026: active preparation now targets v0.0.41-dev1. The planned final release title is **v0.0.41: Collisions And Boundaries**. Earlier source snapshots, checks and findings retain their recorded version identities; they do not establish acceptance of this development candidate. Matching source validation, completed image assembly/readback, native checks, packaging and delivery remain separate gates. See [development preparation](../RELEASE-v0.0.41-dev1.md).

## Symptom and location

15 October 2026: exact allocation and predecessor-world checks remain separately recorded. The later 941 world stopped at its ownership guard because named aprons bypassed ten existing deferred-owner dispositions. The source-only disposition repair passes 38 focused checks; fresh world, boundary/model review and native/package acceptance remain pending.

## How it happened

AmiQuake's existing Mod_LoadNodes point_hull_only path allocates dclipnode_t
nodes for hull-zero traces and omits the renderer mnode_t array. AW_BrushBound
still reserved both arrays for placed models. The heap predictor mirrored that
excess reservation, so its refusal agreed with the oversized runtime arena.

## Why it was not caught

The bound and predictor agreed with each other, but their point-hull allocation
was not checked against the actual decoder's allocations for this model kind.

## Reproduction

Use the same four affected regional frames with the actual target ABI. Before
the allocation repair, (10,0), (10,1), (9,2), (11,0) peak at 6,957,632;
6,939,952; 6,644,768; 5,875,568 bytes. The active budget is 6,242,304 bytes.
Three frames fail; all four pass structural validation.

## Repair

AW_BrushBound accepts an explicit point_hull_only argument. ChimModels_Begin
sets it only for CHIM_KIND_MODEL. The bound and tools/chim/heap.py omit only the
unused renderer-node reservation for those models. Terrain keeps its existing
node allocation. This reuses the existing AmiQuake point-hull decoder; geometry,
collision data, budgets and draw distance remain unchanged.

## Verification

15 October 2026: the same world bytes, using actual target ABI sizes, pass all
four active-ring heap gates: (10,0) 5,728,896 bytes, headroom 513,408;
(10,1) 5,711,216, headroom 531,088; (9,2) 6,072,752, headroom 169,552;
(11,0) 4,700,432, headroom 1,541,872. These are active-ring results; speculative
load-ring peaks are separately reported and are not active-ring acceptance.

World index SHA-256: `0b72ce08385de760612cca5b3c818a4ea5dd3e71350c968810fd431bd0a831a7`.
Allocation source model.c SHA-256: `cc088069ea0b78537a4cdeb3177705933247a1bf26f3bb66c78ba22d70eea137`.
Heap predictor SHA-256: `77ba705d0b7b61926096da765fa8bf9cd9662753aea849dece83bc63e26b4c26`.
The receipt confirms unchanged world bytes and requires the candidate engine.
The focused host receipt is dated 15 October 2026 at 14:54:37 UTC. Its seven
C checks compare direct and streamed decoded fields and 80 point-hull contents
queries; 17 heap checks pass. This is host fixture evidence only.
The exact allocation candidate subsequently compiled successfully; the complete
suite and browser mirror follow-up are recorded below. Native/package acceptance
remain pending. Earlier source's full suite ran 4,235 tests with
4,229 passes, three Windows-only skips and three Census expected failures;
it does not validate this changed allocation source.

## Allocation mirrors follow-up, 15 October 2026

The first complete allocation-candidate suite ran 4,236 tests: 4,228 passed,
two failed, zero errors, three Windows-only skips and three tracked Census
expected failures. The failures were test_inspector_page_opens_chim_maps_and_worlds
and test_world_reader_matches_the_python_reader_and_the_heap_gate. The browser
still reserved the omitted mnode array, while Python used the repaired allocation.
A first focused browser follow-up also failed both parity checks and is retained
as failed evidence; it did not establish repair acceptance.

The browser imageBytes helper now carries an explicit pointHullOnly argument.
Only placed models enable it; terrain keeps its existing node accounting.
Toolkit own version 0.1.4 records this follow-up; its header names AmiWind v0.0.41.
The map inspector recomputation, production predictor fit and zone simulator also
name the placed-model point-hull allocation mode explicitly. The synthetic Python
oracle mirrors that role; terrain keeps the original accounting in every caller.
29 focused browser, zone-simulator and heap checks pass with no failures, errors or skips and
unchanged source. The 24 earlier C-loader/heap host checks and unchanged-world
four-frame heap results remain distinct evidence. The exact earlier allocation
source compiled to engine SHA-256 `cdc6e71e0a3a83f74521fec2b02ad5a4b04f1dad667011a9af52b23e4206170d`.
No Amiga/native execution follows from this compile or the host fixtures.
At that focused-only checkpoint the complete follow-up suite, complete
successor world and native/package gates were still pending.

## Complete-suite and world checkpoint, 15 October 2026

Exact immutable source928 (manifest SHA-256
`f79552c3e4f85877ef7e94162a6d567b3a3d8aed990763b571731a7bf316dd94`)
passed 4,236 tests: 4,230 passes, zero failures/errors, three Windows-only
skips and three tracked Census expected failures. Source and pin were unchanged.
This supersedes the earlier failed925fullsuite for the changed allocation mirrors;
the original failure remains historical evidence. The present documentation-only
follow-up uses affected record/export checks and does not rewrite either pin.

The successor369-frame world now has structural PASS, source_checked=true,
zero structural failures and369active-heap PASS results. Maximum6,072,752bytes
fits the unchanged6,242,304-byte active budget. The925zone allocator receipt
passes369walks; the928zone simulator changed and must be rerun on this same
world. At15:24:00UTC the running stair log had reached366/369frames and
687,584/696,414stairs with zero failures in the latest lines; it was incomplete.
That partial observation is historical. Final conversion completed at15:24:22UTC
with exit0 and unchanged source/inputs. The scoped stair gate passed369frames,
92,539tested steps/ramps, zero blocking failures and14,960advisory failures.
All369frames were walked, none reused from the walk cache. These advisories
remain visible; the gate does not certify all ramp/contact gameplay.
Actor/contact and seam review are separate; updated928zone recheck is pending.

Exact player-reuse verification confirms243assets/31,235,875bytes: original
inputs, palette and adopted environment verified, and37producer dependency
files identical against the earlier producer. This authorizes exact reuse,
not native appearance, animation or all-player acceptance. Native, package,
shipment and maintainer acceptance remain separate pending gates.

## Zone, actor and model checkpoint, 15 October 2026

The exact immutable 928 zone simulator rechecked the same completed world:
369 walks pass, with both source and world inputs unchanged. This completes
the required updated-simulator recheck without borrowing the earlier 925 result.

The corrected actor check passes for 17 serialized actors in its named final
frame, including Nels and the dreamer. The receipt reports 15 grounded and 2 refitted
under the existing tolerance and refit limit; explicit row exceptions remain
recorded. This does not modify actor output or establish native actor behavior.
The earlier metadata-only path and module-import failures remain historical.

All 22 isolated model comparisons completed with unchanged inputs, equal face
counts, unique one-to-one nearest faces and no sampled hit/no-hit disagreement.
These are measurements requiring review: maximum render residual is
0.00046626117940436586 and maximum sampled collision fraction residual is
0.000122639726557211. Three fraction results are null because no matching hit
was available; null is not zero. No new acceptance tolerance is introduced,
and sampled agreement does not prove universal collision or visual equivalence.

Provenance lookup returned no rows for 14 sprite companions and needs further
investigation. This does not demonstrate that runtime sprites are absent.
Keep the original reference IDs and both lookup sides; complete provenance,
model and sprite review before acceptance. Nine Vivec boundary findings remain
held and native suspect captures await a runtime image. No package or delivery
artifact exists for this candidate.

## Prevention

Check both direct and streamed brush loading against the exact bound, decoded
fields and point-hull traces. Keep placed-model and terrain reservations distinct
and compare the predictor with the actual target ABI before complete conversion.
