_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.43-dev3 (18 October 2026)._

## Status: 18 October 2026

Open. Reported by the maintainer during the v0.0.43-dev2 playtest.

## Symptom

With 128 MB of Fast RAM, entering Vivec still warns "hunk-gap safety below 2 MiB. Region requires memory review",
and loading pauses show while travelling. The heap line reports a total of 11,534,336 bytes.

## Where

The engine's start-up (`engine/aga/src/sys_amiga.c`, `Sys_Init`): the game heap is the size the build chose
(`AMIWIND_HEAP_MB`, 11 MiB) unless the game is started with `-heapmb N`.

## How it happened

The heap size was set for the 16 MB Fast RAM baseline and is fixed at build time. Nothing looks at how much memory
the machine actually has, so extra RAM stays unused.

## Why it was not caught

Every test machine and every playtest preset ran with the baseline memory, where the fixed size is the right one.

## Reproduction

Start v0.0.43-dev2 on a machine with 128 MB of Fast RAM and enter Vivec; read the heap line and the warning.

## Repair

Planned: size the heap from the Fast RAM actually free at start (the largest free block, minus a reserve for the
system and sound), never below the built size; `-heapmb N` stays the override. Designed together with the
prefetch of neighbouring areas into spare memory. The 16 MB baseline behaves exactly as today.

## Verification

Heap lines and the Vivec warning on 16, 64 and 128 MB presets; crossing pauses measured before and after.

## Prevention

A test of the heap sizing rule for each memory preset.
