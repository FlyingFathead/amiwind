## Status: 11 October 2026

Open; repaired in source on v0.0.36-build-timeline, not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

After `CHIM stair gate: passed (...)` and the receipt (23:54:22 +0300), the chim stage of
`2026_10_10_v0.0.36-dev3_full-coast-chim-regions-270-compiled-hull_3b5e7a9` printed nothing until
`chim-stats: ... (2768 models, 11174 placements, 62667 chunks)`: `chim-stats.json` was written at 00:02:07, about
7 min 44 s later. One process ran, its CPU time rising by about a second per second. The same tail is the likely
cause of the long one-core end of the chim stage in the routed-hull run before it (not checked).

## Where

`tools/chim/stats.py` `main`: `validate()` and `measure()` on the whole world, after `tools/chim_build.py` had run
the same validation and measurement (`chim/validate.py main`, 23:00:11 to 23:08:49 in that run) and thrown the
result away.

## How it happened

The statistics were written as a standalone command that validates what it reads, so the numbers describe what
is on disk. The builder called that command as is, after its own validation and the three gates.

## Why it was not caught

On three-frame worlds both validations took seconds.

## Reproduction

Always: `chim_build.py --validate --stats`. Measured on the finished world of the run above, read-only, in one
process (2 CPUs, a busy host): reading the world 14.5 s; `validate()` with that read 593.0 s wall, 592.1 s CPU;
`measure()` with the 10 benchmark cameras 1.1 s; the statistics themselves (`chim_stats`) 2.7 s; writing 0.3 s.
Everything but about 4 seconds is the second validation.

## Repair

`chim.validate.report_world` returns the report, the validated world and the walk replays (`validate.py main`
writes the same report through it). `chim_build.py` validates once, writes `chim-validate.json` and its stdout as
before, and right after (the gates never change the world) calls `chim.stats.main` with that world and its
measurements; the statistics add the benchmark cameras (`camera_report`, what `measure()` adds for cameras).
`stats.py OUT` alone still validates. Both are timed phases with start and end lines, and the builder's heartbeat
names the phase while it runs (BUILD-PROFILE-SECTIONS-MISSING-36). Expected in a build: the statistics phase
takes about 4 seconds instead of about 8 minutes.

## Verification

`tests/test_build_phases.py` `StatsReuseTests`: on the synthetic world of `tests/test_chim_format.py`, the
statistics from the build's validation and the statistics that validate again are the same bytes (SHA-256), and
`validate.py --json` writes the same report as before.

## Prevention

Remaining: the one validation still runs on one core, frame after frame (about 10 minutes on this world).
Parallel validation per frame (through the shared worker pool, results merged in frame order) and a per-frame
cache by the SHA-256 of the frame's files are the next step; not done in this change.

- [BUILD-CHIM-STAIR-JOBS-AT-LAUNCH-42](BUILD-CHIM-STAIR-JOBS-AT-LAUNCH-42.md): In-stage pools of the CHIM step stay at the --jobs the stage was launched with: the v0.0.42 final's stair gate walked on 2 workers with an allowance of 12
- [BUILD-CHIM-STAIR-NO-REUSE-42](BUILD-CHIM-STAIR-NO-REUSE-42.md): The v0.0.42 final walked all 1,118 frames again: the walks of the passed dev1 build carry no check mark, because its launcher never promotes them

- [BUILD-PROFILER-NO-WASTE-ALARM-36](BUILD-PROFILER-NO-WASTE-ALARM-36.md): No profiler, perf ledger or gate flagged idle cores, work done for maps that are removed, or growth of the image
- [BUILD-PROGRESS-ETA-BASIS-36](BUILD-PROGRESS-ETA-BASIS-36.md): The live build progress took a stage's expected time from earlier runs of any size: dev3's chim stage was expected at 154 s and ran 1 h 48 min
- [BUILD-RESOURCE-PLAN-CHIM-ESTIMATE-44](BUILD-RESOURCE-PLAN-CHIM-ESTIMATE-44.md): The resource plan estimated the CHIM stage at 2 workers and 6 h 13 min; it ran on 24 workers in about 75 min

- [BUILD-SCHEDULER-EVEN-SHARE-33](BUILD-SCHEDULER-EVEN-SHARE-33.md): The stage scheduler splits the workers evenly between running stages, so the longest stage gets no more than the shortest (MiniWind media on 1 of 4 workers for 1,195 s)

- [BUILD-STAIR-GATE-OOM-42](BUILD-STAIR-GATE-OOM-42.md): The CHIM stair gate runs a whole-Vivec MiniWind out of memory: its worker pool breaks
- [BUILD-STAIR-WALK-BORDER-COPIES-41](BUILD-STAIR-WALK-BORDER-COPIES-41.md): The CHIM stair gate walks every frame's whole border, so each cell's flights are walked many times and unreachable copies can fail a build
- [BUILD-STAIR-WALK-SLOW-33](BUILD-STAIR-WALK-SLOW-33.md): The image step's stair walk spent most of its time in interpreted collision traces and brute-force headroom tests (1,751 s of the rc1c image step)
