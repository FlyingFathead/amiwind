## Status: 7 October 2026

Open. Cause read in source; no repair yet.

## Symptom

With the debug overlay on, a console message such as the heap audit line
("Heap maps/bm026.bsp first-presented: ...") appears at the top of the screen
on top of the "AmiWind v... Vvardenfell / ..." title; both become unreadable
for a few seconds (maintainer screenshot, Balmora, 17:15).

Seen again in v0.0.31-dev3 with the autosave message ("Saved Autosave 2 ...")
over the title in Seyda Neen.

## Where

Quake's console notify lines (recent `Con_Printf` output shown at the top of the
view for a few seconds) and the AmiWind debug title (`aw_hud.c`, drawn at the
top-left). The heap audit message comes from `aw_stream.c` on the first frame
of a new map.

## How it happened

Both draw in the same rows at the top of the screen; neither knows about the
other.

## Why it was not caught

The heap audit message appears only on the first frame of a map, and captures
are usually taken later.

## Reproduction

Debug overlay on; cross into a new region map and look at the top of the screen.

## Repair

17 October 2026 (v0.0.42-dev2 line, found again in v0.0.42-dev1 at Vivec: the debug title drawn over the
inspect pin's console lines at the top left): the title no longer shares the top rows. While the HUD strip is
under the view, the title is drawn in that strip, on the line above the stat bars (an inspect pin takes those
lines while it is shown), so nothing debug sits over the view or over Quake's notify lines. Full-screen views
without a strip (photo mode with Ctrl+H) keep the title at the top as before. The inspect pin's rows go to the
console without notify lines (`con_notify_quiet`), since the strip shows them.

## Verification

`tests/aga_hud_test.c`: with a strip, the title is drawn inside it and no debug string is drawn above
`vid.height - sb_lines`; without a strip it stays at the top. `tests/aga_inspect_test.c`: the pin's console rows
are printed without notify lines. In game: pending a MiniWind frame.

## Prevention

The HUD native test fails when a debug string is drawn inside the view while a strip exists.
