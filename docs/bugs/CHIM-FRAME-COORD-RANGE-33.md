## Status: 10 October 2026

Open. Plan correction; nothing shipped is affected. The engine's hand-over bound stays at 4,000
local units. The one-city-frame plan for Vivec needs a decision.

Measured on 10 October 2026 from the district configs (handoff cores, the Arena's inset core
included; the M3 preflight): one city frame is 96 units over in x and 608 in y. Of the two-frame
option, the south frame (Temple, St. Delyn, St. Olms: +/-2,048 x 2,560) fits, but the north frame
does not: its cores span cells 2 to 5, 8,192 units east-west, 96 over on each side, so its outer
cores must be trimmed by at least 97 units each (repair option 1 already said "trimmed"). Three
frames fit without trimming: south, (Hlaalu, Redoran, Foreign Quarter) at +/-3,072 x 2,048, and
(Arena, Telvanni) at +/-2,320 x 1,744. The eight district frames overlap in 16 of 28 pairs, so one
CHIM world cannot hold them all as they are (`chim/areas.py` refuses overlapping frames).

## Symptom

The Vivec frame plan (`docs/chim/WORLD_FORMAT.md`) proposed one city frame and raising the engine's
hand-over bound for table frames from 4,000 to 8,000 local units, on the grounds that "shorts reach
32,767". That premise is wrong. Quake sends every position as a 16-bit integer of eighths of a unit
(`MSG_WriteCoord` writes `(int)(f*8)` as a short; `MSG_ReadCoord` divides by 8). A coordinate
therefore wraps past about +/-4,096 units. That covers the player's origin, entity updates, sounds,
particles and static entities, and it applies in single player too, because the local client reads
the same messages.

The eight Vivec district cores span 8,192 units east-west and 9,216 north-south. A frame's player
area must stay within about +/-4,000 of its origin, 8,000 per axis. So one city frame cannot hold
the walk through the city.

## Where

- The frame plan in `docs/chim/WORLD_FORMAT.md` (stage B, item 2).
- `engine/aga/src/aw_world.c`: `valid_town` and the arrival checks in `AW_WorldDestination` and
  `AW_WorldMapTarget` (4,000).
- The same range is already assumed in other places: the draw-distance cap in `aw_fog.c`
  ("Quake's coordinate range", 4,096), NPC path clamps in `aw_npcpath.c`, and spawn and scene
  checks in `aw_spawn.c` and `aw_scene.c` (4,000).

## How it happened

The plan looked only at the format's integer fields, which do reach 32,767. It did not check the
engine's network coordinate encoding. The 4,000 bound in `aw_world.c` exists because of that
encoding.

## Why it was not caught

The plan was written and agreed as a design note. No frame larger than +/-4,000 has been built,
and the bound was due to be raised without a test of positions beyond 4,096.

## Reproduction

Read `MSG_WriteCoord` and `MSG_ReadCoord` in `engine/aga/src/common.c`. Then compare the union of
the Vivec district cores in the generated town table: x from 4,096 to 12,288, y from -27,648 to
-18,432.

## Repair

Not yet decided. The options are:

1. Two or more city frames, each with a core box within +/-4,000 of its origin. For example, a
   south frame (Temple, St. Delyn, St. Olms) and a north frame (the rest) with its outer waterfront
   trimmed. This gives one hand-over inside the city instead of eight district frames.
2. A wider coordinate encoding for the whole protocol: one change to `MSG_WriteCoord` and
   `MSG_ReadCoord` and a protocol version bump. Messages grow (the dense static sign-on is already
   near `MAX_MSGLEN`), and every place in the engine that assumes 4,000 or 4,096 needs an audit.
   This is an engine-wide change.
3. M4 frames whose ring spans frame edges. This is the open-world answer, already planned.

Until then, the eight district frames stay in place and the bound stays at 4,000.

Project decision (10 October 2026): option 2 first, as a measured spike, then one city frame. In source
(branch v0.0.36-vivec-chim), behind the engine compile switch `AW_EXP_WIDECOORD`, off by default:

- `engine/aga/src/aw_coord.h`: a coordinate travels as 24 bits of 1/256 units (+/-32,768 units, the
  range of the BSP node and leaf bounds), clamped instead of wrapped; `MSG_WriteCoord` and
  `MSG_ReadCoord` (`common.c`) are still the only place positions are encoded. The protocol number
  becomes 1015 with the switch, so a narrow and a wide engine never read each other's messages or
  demos; saved games keep positions as text.
- `AW_COORD_BOUND` (4,000, or 32,000 with the switch) replaces the literal bound in `aw_world.c`
  (`valid_town`, the region cover check and both arrival checks), `aw_spawn.c` and `aw_scene.c`.
- Every 4000 / 4096 / 4095 in the engine and in the builder's frame checks is classified in
  `config/coord-range-audit.json` (4 bound, 16 kept with the reason, 46 unrelated); a test fails on
  any new one. Kept on purpose: the view distance cap (a distance, not a position), trace lengths and
  start heights, path step clamps, grafted leaf z bounds. The builder's own bounds (`town_config.handoff`,
  `prepare_world_regions`) stay at 4,000 until a builder option selects the wide engine.
- The default build is unchanged (Quake's encoding, protocol 15); the wide engine compiles for the
  68040 with no warnings.

Measurement plan (after the dev3 build, before any default change): the sign-on message of the
densest map (static entities and baselines: 3 bytes more each, against `MAX_MSGLEN`), the bytes per
frame of the server messages at the Vivec Arena arrival and in Balmora, and the time per frame of the
encode and decode on the slow 68040 profile, narrow against wide at the same poses; then a builder
option that compiles the wide engine and raises the builder's bounds with it, and a MiniWind build of
a Vivec frame wider than +/-4,096 that walks across the old bound.

## Verification

Host tests: `tests/test_coord_wide_native.py` (the 24-bit encoding round-trips the whole range to within
half a 1/256 unit, clamps, and the switch sets the bound and protocol; the default keeps 4,000 and 15) and
`tests/test_coord_range_audit.py` (the audit list is complete and current; the engine bounds use
`AW_COORD_BOUND`). Still to do: the player and an entity beyond the old bound in a real map, after the
measurements above.

## Prevention

Every CHIM frame-size proposal states its largest local coordinate against Quake's +/-4,096 range.

- [CHIM-WORLD-INDEX-FILE-LIMIT-36](CHIM-WORLD-INDEX-FILE-LIMIT-36.md): The engine refuses a CHIM world index with more than 4096 file rows; the dev3 coast world has 7,236, so every CHIM frame map fails
- [CHIM-YAW-PLAYER-BOX-TURNS-46](CHIM-YAW-PLAYER-BOX-TURNS-46.md): The player collision box turns with a yawed CHIM model (OpenMW keeps it world-aligned)
- [CHIM-ZONE-RELEASE-FLICKER-42](CHIM-ZONE-RELEASE-FLICKER-42.md): Full CHIM zone: distant buildings pop in and out while standing still, and the retry costs frames
- [CHIM-ZONE-RING-THRASH-33](CHIM-ZONE-RING-THRASH-33.md): Balmora's chunk ring does not fit the default 6 MiB CHIM zone, so the cache thrashes
- [CHIM-ZONE-TMP-NOEXEC-33](CHIM-ZONE-TMP-NOEXEC-33.md): The CHIM zone walk gate cannot load its host library when /tmp is mounted noexec
- [CHIM-ZONE-UNSATISFIABLE-EVICT-35](CHIM-ZONE-UNSATISFIABLE-EVICT-35.md): The CHIM zone evicts every unlocked block for a request no free run can hold
- [CHIMPORT-OCEAN-LAND-41](CHIMPORT-OCEAN-LAND-41.md): 98 seabed cells (land records entirely under water) are marked open ocean: CHIMport never plans them and the ocean admission refuses them
- [CHIMPORT-RETRY-LAVA-STALE-SOURCE-36](CHIMPORT-RETRY-LAVA-STALE-SOURCE-36.md): CHIMport --retry-failed cannot rerun a lava cell of the island run: its stored source stage predates the lava conversion
- [CHIMPORT-SEABED-NO-ISLAND-42](CHIMPORT-SEABED-NO-ISLAND-42.md): Seabed cells measured as empty sea lose their island in the tracker: they drop out of the published reference and the build calls them unknown
- [COMBAT-PURSUIT-SLOPE-STALL-46](COMBAT-PURSUIT-SLOPE-STALL-46.md): A pursuer stops on a walkable slope: an actor step was refused when it moved more than a stair height along the slope
- IMAGE-FORMATS-CHIM-ROOMS-48 (no report page): The payload preflight stops a CHIM rooms build: the image step does not know the room store and room record formats
- IMAGE-ROOM-MAPS-ENGINE-REFUSED-48 (no report page): Every CHIM room is refused at its door and the game hangs on Loading: the engine accepts a .chim map only with a CHIM frame key
- IMAGE-ROOM-MAPS-FINGERPRINT-48 (no report page): A CHIM rooms build stops at the content fingerprint: it requires maps/<room>.bsp after the room became maps/<room>.chim
- [IMAGE-ROOM-MAPS-LATE-PASSES-48](IMAGE-ROOM-MAPS-LATE-PASSES-48.md): Image checks after the CHIM rooms install skip CHIM rooms: entity tracker 47 cells against 52, dressing 81 pieces against 99, actor contact 0 placements against 93
- IMAGE-ROOM-MAPS-OPTIMIZER-RECEIPT-48 (no report page): A CHIM rooms build stops at the map optimizer check: the room maps are staged but not in the optimizer receipt
- IMAGE-ROOM-MAPS-SKIP-PASSES-48 (no report page): CHIM rooms were installed before the image passes that write a room worldspawn, so CHIM room maps would miss interior sky, hand metadata and cell numbers
