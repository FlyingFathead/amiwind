# BUILD-SURVEY-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33: The world-survey stage writes its wall time into its outputs, so a rerun never has the same outputs

| Persists in | v0.0.33-rc1 (last seen) |
| Severity | medium: A world-survey stage that runs again never matches its earlier outputs, so every stage depending on it is refused reuse. |

## Status: 9 October 2026

Open. The repair (wall time to the log only) is held for the next release line: it changes the stage's
source fingerprint, so the v0.0.33 final would build the survey and every stage after it again.

Provenance: found comparing the stage records of the v0.0.33-rc1 builds rc1b (27058ec) and rc1c (a266a40).

## Symptom

world-survey wrote 2 of its 2,819 files differently in two builds from the same inputs:
`world-survey.json` and `Vvardenfell-atlas.html`. The only difference is `summary.seconds` (60.35 against
53.04), which the atlas page embeds.

## Where

`tools/survey_vvardenfell.py`, the report's `summary` (`seconds=round(time.monotonic()-start,2)`).

## How it happened

The survey recorded how long it took inside its own report, which is a stage output.

## Why it was not caught

Stage outputs were never compared across two runs of the same inputs for this stage; the reuse planner only
needs that when the stage runs again, which BUILD-REUSE-SCRATCH-UNDECLARED-33 hid.

## Reproduction

Run the world-survey stage twice on the same inputs and compare `world-survey.json`.

## Repair

Planned: print the wall time to the log only (the build profile records stage times).

## Verification

Planned: a test that the survey report carries no wall time, and a second run of the stage comparing bytes.

## Prevention

Stage outputs carry no wall-clock values; timings go to logs and the build profile.
