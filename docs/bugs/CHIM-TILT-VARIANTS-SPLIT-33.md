## Status: 9 October 2026

Open; measured. The fix is next-release work. It does not change v0.0.33.

## Symptom

In the Vivec Temple frame's peak ring, the coda flowers take 22 model blocks (476 KB) and the fire
petals 21 blocks (196 KB, 48 triangles each), where store-once would give one model per mesh. Every
placement tilted off the vertical gets its own model: the variant key of a tilted placement holds
its tilt and its yaw, so no two tilted placements share a model.

Island-wide census of the base master (`Morrowind.esm`; Tribunal and Bloodmoon not yet counted):

| | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Meshes placed | 3,680 |
| Placements | 305,858 |
| Meshes with tilted placements | 1,476 |
| Tilted placements | 50,108 (29,862 in exterior cells) |
| Model variants from tilt | 39,103 |

The largest splits: `ex_barnacles_02` (1,985 variants), `furn_shell20` (1,265), `flora_bc_grass_01`
(1,218), `furn_shell10` (1,104), `ex_barnacles_03` (886), `flora_kelp_03` (871),
`flora_ash_grass_w_01` (776), `flora_wickwheat_01` (716), `contain_egg_kwama00` (679), `furn_bone_01`
(644). A small plant's block measured 9 to 22 KB in the Temple world, so the split costs on the
order of several hundred MB of model data across the island (an estimate, not measured per mesh).
Within a ring, every tilted copy is a separate zone block.

## Where

`prepare_mesh_bsp._instance_key`, the variant identity the CHIM builder shares (`chim.build.variant_key`):
a tilted placement's key adds its yaw. The CHIM placement record and the chunk collision handle yaw
only (`chim_chunks.c`: "offset, yaw rotation"), so the tilt is baked into the model.

## How it happened

The legacy converter baked each tilted placement into its own brush model, because a legacy region
map has no per-placement rotation for static geometry. CHIM kept that identity when it began storing
models once, so tilt still splits them.

## Why it was not caught

Store-once was measured on Balmora, Seyda Neen and the Arena, which have few tilted placements. The
Temple frame's plant clusters showed it first.

## Reproduction

A census of `Morrowind.esm`: count placements whose pitch or roll is not zero, and
distinct (scale, pitch, roll, yaw) per mesh. Or read a CHIM world's model list: tilted meshes appear
as `name@s..@t..` variants.

## Repair

Planned: one model per mesh, with the rotation per placement, as Quake entities carry angles.

- The engine renders brush models with full angles (`R_RotateBmodel`), and `SV_ClipMoveToEntity`
  rotates a trace into a model's frame for any angles.
- CHIM's own chunk clip handles yaw only, and the placement record stores yaw only. Both need pitch
  and roll (a format change), and the Python collision mirrors (`chim.collision`) follow.
- Limit: Quake rotates the trace, not the standing box, so a tilted model's standing hull is
  approximate (the box stays axis-aligned in the model's frame). The stair gate and the walk check
  measure the effect before tilted models change form.

## Verification

Pending: a census of variants before and after, the Temple ring peak, and the stair and walk gates
on tilted placements.

## Prevention

The CHIM stats report models per mesh, so a mesh split into more than one variant is listed.

Family: CHIM world streamer (`chim-streamer`). The CHIM streamer keeps Quake's visibility effective and its renderer counters must not get worse. See [families](README.md#families).
