## Status: 9 October 2026

Open. Found by the voice study.

## Symptom

Each resident always greets with one fixed line, chosen by the highest disposition threshold up to 50;
greetings are kept 8 seconds apart across all actors.

## Where

`src/mwad/npc.py` `greeting_fixture`; `engine/aga/qc/world.qc` (`aw_voice_deadline`).

## How it happened

The greeting was written as a bounded audition before the dialogue rules were studied.

## Why it was not caught

A single greeting sounds plausible.

## Reproduction

Approach a resident several times: always the same line.

## Repair

Planned: the greeting through the voice line table (first match with Random100 and the other runtime
conditions), the per-actor speaking rule instead of the global gap.

## Verification

Pending.

## Prevention

One voice line selector for every topic.
