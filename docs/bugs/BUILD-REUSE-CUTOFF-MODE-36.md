# BUILD-REUSE-CUTOFF-MODE-36: Early cutoff compared file modes with their write bits: a stage reused by hard link (read-only) never matched the same bytes written fresh, so 10 stages after dev3's bsp rerun were refused

## Status: 11 October 2026

Open; repaired in source on v0.0.36-build-timeline, not shipped at the time of writing. Hold-level (a reuse
bug that reruns verified work).

## Symptom

`2026_10_10_v0.0.36-dev3_full-coast-chim-regions-270-compiled-hull_3b5e7a9` reused from the routed-hull run.
The bsp stage ran again because `tools/collision_bsp.py` changed. Its outputs were byte-identical to the old run:
the same 67 files with the same SHA-256 (only its four tool logs differ, and logs are diagnostics). The stage
hash trees were equal. Even so, the reuse audit refused hands, world-flora-assets, harvest, hand-catalog,
door-audio, character, reading, world-ui, actor-contact and world-terrain as UNEXPECTED, with "an earlier stage it
depends on ran again and its outputs differ from the old run: bsp, hands, npcs". Those stages ran again: about
455 s of stage wall time and about 40 CPU-minutes, off the critical path.

## Where

`tools/build_cache.py` `same_outputs`: after the stage hashes match, it compares every file's mode.

## How it happened

The routed-hull run had itself reused bsp, by hard link from the storage pool. A linked file is made read-only
(`link_file`: mode without the write bits), so that run's record of bsp lists mode 0o444. The fresh rerun wrote
the same bytes with mode 0o644. The mode check counted that as a different output.

## Why it was not caught

The early-cutoff tests compared two fresh runs (both 0o644). A reuse source that had itself reused the stage by
link was never in a test.

## Reproduction

Always: a stage reused by hard link in run A, rerun with identical outputs in run B that reuses from A.

## Repair

`same_outputs` compares `output_modes`: each file's mode without the write bits. The read and execute bits
still count, so an executable bit that changes is still a difference.

## Verification

`tests/test_build_cache.py` `DiagnosticOutputTests.test_a_read_only_reused_copy_has_the_same_outputs`: 0o644
against 0o444 is the same output, both ways; 0o755 against 0o644 is not. On the dev3 run itself (read-only), the
repaired comparison finds bsp, npcs, hands, interior, intro, census, area, world-flora-assets, harvest,
hand-catalog, balmora-interiors, door-audio, character, reading, opening-references, world-ui, world-terrain,
world-scenery and world-flora unchanged. actor-contact still differs, because its `id1/seyda-regions.json` named
intro-scene inputs by absolute run-folder path. That is a second case of BUILD-SEYDA-BOUNDED-RUN-PATHS-36, also
repaired on this branch.

## Prevention

Identity is the SHA-256 of the content (the stage hash tree). The mode comparison keeps only what changes
behaviour (read and execute bits).

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Build reuse keys and output attribution (`build-cache-reuse`). A unit is rebuilt only when the content hash of all its inputs changes or its output is missing or damaged. Keys never under-declare (a missed input allows a wrong reuse) and should not over-declare (a file no output depends on forces rebuilds); outputs carry no wall-clock values; every changed file is credited to the stage that wrote it. See [families](README.md#families).

- [BUILD-ACTOR-LIBRARY-MWAD-PATH-47](BUILD-ACTOR-LIBRARY-MWAD-PATH-47.md): The actor-library stage stopped at once: run as a script, tools/mwad.py hid the src/mwad package
- [BUILD-CACHE-OWNER-FAILS-STAGE-34](BUILD-CACHE-OWNER-FAILS-STAGE-34.md): A cache entry owned by another user failed a release build four minutes in, instead of being rebuilt or caught before any stage
- [BUILD-CACHE-PROVENANCE-41](BUILD-CACHE-PROVENANCE-41.md): Some cache entries record no time or no versions: pool keys from CHIMport have empty versions and commit, world-terrain units and stage records have no creation time or version
- BUILD-CACHE-PROVENANCE-GROWTH-54 (no report page): chim-units/.provenance is one append-only 8.8 GB file; its growth per build is not measured
- BUILD-CELL-PROGRESS-ENGINE-KEY-48 (no report page): The tracker data stage (cell-progress) counted every engine source in its key: an engine-only edit rebuilt it
- [BUILD-CELL-PROGRESS-KEY-BUGS-35](BUILD-CELL-PROGRESS-KEY-BUGS-35.md): Every bug registration stopped builds at the reuse preflight: the cell-progress key held all of docs/
- BUILD-CHIM-KEY-ENGINE-FILE-WHOLE-54 (no report page): chim_world.c is keyed whole into the CHIM world, so a diagnostic print re-keys the world
- BUILD-CHIM-KEY-ENGINE-SOURCES-49 (no report page): An engine source edit rebuilds the whole CHIM world: the CHIM stage imports project_version, whose engine check names engine/aga/src files
- [BUILD-CHIM-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-35](BUILD-CHIM-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-35.md): The CHIM stage's fingerprint left out the tracker code it ran (8 files, 2 functions): a wrong-reuse risk
- [BUILD-CHIM-KEY-VERSION-48](BUILD-CHIM-KEY-VERSION-48.md): The CHIM world and cell-progress stages key on VERSION, so a version-only bump (rc to final) rebuilds the whole CHIM world
- [BUILD-CHIM-LABEL-IN-KEYS-48](BUILD-CHIM-LABEL-IN-KEYS-48.md): The CHIM version label was in the stage keys: the x.x.1 release step rebuilt about 25 stages, the CHIM world among them
- BUILD-CHIM-RECORD-COMPILER-INCOMPLETE-51 (no report page): The chim stage's read record is always incomplete: it starts compilers with checkout paths, so it can never be reused when only its key's sources changed
- BUILD-CHIM-VIS-RECOMPUTED-48 (no report page): The CHIM stage recomputed every region frame's visibility (1 h 20 min on 24 cores)
- [BUILD-CUTOFF-WHOLE-ANCESTOR-51](BUILD-CUTOFF-WHOLE-ANCESTOR-51.md): An interior light change reran exterior stages: the reuse cutoff refuses a stage when any earlier stage's whole output differs, not the files it reads
- BUILD-DEV-GALLERY-SKIP-RC-REBUILD-48 (no report page): Development builds leave out the NPC gallery, so every release candidate builds all 3,551 faces fresh
- [BUILD-DIAGNOSTIC-INPUT-REFUSED-36](BUILD-DIAGNOSTIC-INPUT-REFUSED-36.md): The cell-progress stage was never reusable: it reads the CHIM stage's statistics report, which counted as a forbidden diagnostic read
- [BUILD-ENGINE-KEY-SDK-33](BUILD-ENGINE-KEY-SDK-33.md): The engine stage is never reused: the Amiga SDK is not part of its key
- [BUILD-FLORA-RECEIPT-SECONDS-36](BUILD-FLORA-RECEIPT-SECONDS-36.md): The world flora receipt held the stage's wall time, so a rerun with the same inputs never wrote the same receipt
- [BUILD-GALLERY-JSON-KEY-ORDER-35](BUILD-GALLERY-JSON-KEY-ORDER-35.md): NPC gallery outputs differed between two builds only in JSON key order (cache vs fresh results)
- BUILD-IMAGE-LAYOUT-SERIAL-49 (no report page): The image step plans its disk layout and writes its partitions on about 1.6 of 24 cores for about three minutes
- [BUILD-IMAGE-NO-RESUME-33](BUILD-IMAGE-NO-RESUME-33.md): A late failure in the image step reruns the whole image step, and the failing check could have run in its first seconds
- [BUILD-IMAGE-STALE-PYTHONPATH-35](BUILD-IMAGE-STALE-PYTHONPATH-35.md): Builder container images put an old builder copy on PYTHONPATH
- [BUILD-KEY-FUNCTION-DEFAULTS-TOP-36](BUILD-KEY-FUNCTION-DEFAULTS-TOP-36.md): Adding a function to a shared module changed the key of every stage that imports it, although no stage runs the new code
- BUILD-KEY-KEYED-REACH-WHOLE-51 (no report page): Code handed to an in-stage cache key counted whole in the stage key: a helper added to tools/map_files.py rebuilt the CHIM world
- BUILD-KEY-MESH-TABLE-WHOLE-54 (no report page): A per-mesh measured table is keyed whole: one new row of collision-standing-room.json re-keyed every room, resident and model unit
- [BUILD-KEY-OVERBROAD-33](BUILD-KEY-OVERBROAD-33.md): A new bug page or release file list change rebuilds interior, census, harvest and the CHIM stages: an import search path counted as a read of every file under tools/
- BUILD-KEY-RULE-NO-FORM-51 (no report page): A change of the stage key rules without a new key form rebuilt stages whose inputs did not change
- BUILD-KEY-UNIT-RESTORED-CODE-52 (no report page): A stage whose last real run restored its units from a cache was reused after the code those units come from changed: chim-room-batches kept actor models of the old animation tables
- BUILD-MWSCRIPT-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-48 (no report page): The mwscript stage's reuse record is refused: the stage reads tools/mwscript/measure.py, which its fingerprint leaves out
- [BUILD-NPC-BAKE-CACHE-KEY-40](BUILD-NPC-BAKE-CACHE-KEY-40.md): New NPC shell fallback dependencies are absent from the model cache key
- [BUILD-OUTPUTS-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33](BUILD-OUTPUTS-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33.md): A stage that runs again never matches its old outputs (tool logs, timings, run paths), so every stage after it is rebuilt
- [BUILD-PASS-KEY-OVERBROAD-36](BUILD-PASS-KEY-OVERBROAD-36.md): Image-pass and unit cache keys changed with code no pass runs: a new function in a shared module and edits to the cache's own key code rekeyed every character head preview twice (Vivec stage A try2 and try3: 275 of 275 recomputed)
- [BUILD-PASS-KEY-RULE-NO-CARRYOVER-36](BUILD-PASS-KEY-RULE-NO-CARRYOVER-36.md): A pass key rule change carried no entries written by older trees: dev4 recomputed 2,372 optimizer maps and the exterior sky maps with code and outputs identical to dev3
- [BUILD-POOL-APPLY-READ-MISS-35](BUILD-POOL-APPLY-READ-MISS-35.md): In a pool-mode build every reused stage was refused as the next reuse source: the reuse step's read of tools/storage_pool.py counted as a stage input
- [BUILD-POOL-ARG-UNFINGERPRINTED-35](BUILD-POOL-ARG-UNFINGERPRINTED-35.md): The balmora stage was never reusable once the shared storage pool grew past 512 MiB: its --npc-model-pool folder was hashed as an input
- [BUILD-POOL-READONLY-SCENE-WRITE-35](BUILD-POOL-READONLY-SCENE-WRITE-35.md): A pool-mode resume failed in 17 s: npcs could not rewrite its copy of seyda.bsp (copytree kept the pool's read-only mode)
- BUILD-PREFLIGHT-CELL-PROGRESS-VERSION-49 (no report page): The reuse preflight calls the tracker data stage (cell-progress) an unexpected VERSION-only rebuild, though its outputs name the release derived from VERSION
- [BUILD-RESUME-HAZARD-STATIC-35](BUILD-RESUME-HAZARD-STATIC-35.md): A resume failed in 'area': the rebuild hazard counted files of a reused stage that had run again after all
- [BUILD-RESUME-OUTPUTS-DIFFER-35](BUILD-RESUME-OUTPUTS-DIFFER-35.md): Every v0.0.35 resume refused the stages after a rerun scene-chain stage as 'outputs differ' without comparing them
- BUILD-REUSE-APPLY-SERIAL-49 (no report page): Reusing a stage links its cached files on about one core: 34,306 files took 1.4 minutes at the start of a version-only build
- [BUILD-REUSE-ATTRIBUTION-33](BUILD-REUSE-ATTRIBUTION-33.md): Two stages that ran at the same time were both refused reuse when one wrote files under a folder the other only reads
- [BUILD-REUSE-AUDIT-WITHOUT-REASON-36](BUILD-REUSE-AUDIT-WITHOUT-REASON-36.md): The reuse audit and preflight called a stage rerun because its old record was short a replaced file UNEXPECTED, although the reason explains it
- [BUILD-REUSE-CASCADE-36](BUILD-REUSE-CASCADE-36.md): A fix in CHIM-native town code made 23 of 36 stages rebuild: the interior stage reran with different outputs and 5 rebuilds were unexpected
- BUILD-REUSE-FOREIGN-DIRS-52 (no report page): A reused stage recreates, as empty folders, the folders another stage filled beside it: the area stage then stops on its own room folder
- [BUILD-REUSE-INTRO-CENSUS-REPLACED-48](BUILD-REUSE-INTRO-CENSUS-REPLACED-48.md): A reused MiniWind rooms build rebuilt the intro and census stages (replaced outputs) and its Balmora interiors (4 s to 1m21s)
- BUILD-REUSE-KEY-WALK-LISTED-51 (no report page): The read records of the CHIM world stages list almost every folder of the checkout, so a new bug page refuses their narrowed reuse
- BUILD-REUSE-OUTPUTS-DIFFER-48 (no report page): Eight stages were rebuilt because their earlier outputs differed from their records (character, reading, world-ui, actor-contact, world-terrain and others)
- [BUILD-REUSE-PLAN-ENV-36](BUILD-REUSE-PLAN-ENV-36.md): The standalone reuse plan reports environment changes the real build does not have
- BUILD-REUSE-RC1-RECORDS-REFUSED-48 (no report page): Every stage that ran the idle-worker watcher or read the CHIM label module was marked not reusable: rc1-try2 had 24 unexpected rebuilds
- [BUILD-REUSE-RECORD-RETIRED-36](BUILD-REUSE-RECORD-RETIRED-36.md): Early cutoff and the reuse audit lost their records when an older run was retired: stages with byte-identical outputs counted as changed
- [BUILD-REUSE-REDUCED-RECORD-36](BUILD-REUSE-REDUCED-RECORD-36.md): A stage reused from a run that had itself reused it came back without the files a later stage replaced there, so that later stage failed when it ran again
- [BUILD-REUSE-SCHEDULER-TOP-45](BUILD-REUSE-SCHEDULER-TOP-45.md): A scheduler-only edit rekeys every stage, NPC gallery face and stair walk that reaches tools/build_parallel.py
- [BUILD-REUSE-SCRATCH-UNDECLARED-33](BUILD-REUSE-SCRATCH-UNDECLARED-33.md): A rerun with --reuse-from reused 1 of 33 stages: the builder's scratch folder made the first stages non-reusable
- BUILD-REUSE-STOPPED-SOURCE-52 (no report page): Reusing a build that stopped early reruns every stage it never reached, though the build it reused holds them
- [BUILD-REUSE-TMP-RECORDED-DELETED-48](BUILD-REUSE-TMP-RECORDED-DELETED-48.md): A reused stage removed another stage's reuse copies mid-copy: its record listed them as deleted (balmora-interiors stopped at os.replace)
- BUILD-ROOM-BATCHES-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-48 (no report page): The room stage's reuse record is refused: it reads 17 repository files its fingerprint leaves out
- BUILD-ROOM-BATCHES-SCENE-RACE-48 (no report page): A reused build stopped in the room stage: it ran before the area stage had restored the scene map it reads (seyda.bsp)
- [BUILD-SCENE-DIAGNOSTIC-COPY-35](BUILD-SCENE-DIAGNOSTIC-COPY-35.md): Scene-chain stages were never reusable: copying the previous scene (logs included) counted as reading another stage's diagnostics
- [BUILD-SCHEDULER-TABLE-KEY-35](BUILD-SCHEDULER-TABLE-KEY-35.md): A new row in the build scheduler's stage table rebuilds stages that never read it: the table counted as import-time code of every stage
- [BUILD-SEYDA-BOUNDED-RUN-PATHS-36](BUILD-SEYDA-BOUNDED-RUN-PATHS-36.md): The actor-contact stage wrote its run folder path into 67 Seyda Neen region records, so its outputs differed in every run folder
- BUILD-SHARED-WRITES-UNATTRIBUTED-52 (no report page): Stages running side by side write the same files, so their records are refused and they rebuild every time: the town carried-item models, the room door audio
- [BUILD-SPRITE-KEY-HASHLIB-47](BUILD-SPRITE-KEY-HASHLIB-47.md): The CHIM stage failed 45 minutes into a build: the sprite recipe key used hashlib without importing it
- BUILD-STAGE-KEY-WHOLE-CLASS-48 (no report page): A one-method edit in tools/actor_grounding.py rekeyed the CHIM stages: a class was import-time code of its module, so every stage importing the module hashed every method
- [BUILD-STAGE-READS-UNFINGERPRINTED-48](BUILD-STAGE-READS-UNFINGERPRINTED-48.md): Two stages read repository files their fingerprint leaves out, so their records are refused and they rerun on every reuse
- [BUILD-STAIR-KEY-BOOKKEEPING-36](BUILD-STAIR-KEY-BOOKKEEPING-36.md): Stair walk keys count the progress lines (stair_progress.py) and the record bookkeeping (stair_records.py): an edit to either rekeys every walk
- [BUILD-STAIR-PASS-NOT-KEPT-41](BUILD-STAIR-PASS-NOT-KEPT-41.md): A frame's passed stair walk is not reused when the build it ran in failed, and the walker key changes with converter code
- [BUILD-SURVEY-KEY-CONFIG-35](BUILD-SURVEY-KEY-CONFIG-35.md): World survey, world terrain, world UI and CHIM stage keys counted every file under config/: a path built from a loop name read as the whole folder
- [BUILD-SURVEY-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33](BUILD-SURVEY-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33.md): The world-survey stage writes its wall time into its outputs, so a rerun never has the same outputs
- [BUILD-VERSION-GETATTR-TRACE-49](BUILD-VERSION-GETATTR-TRACE-49.md): The v0.0.49 final rebuilt the CHIM world: the lazy VERSION (a module __getattr__ in project_version) ran in the CHIM stage, its read trace recorded it and the key could not
- [CACHE-NO-PROVENANCE-36](CACHE-NO-PROVENANCE-36.md): Cache and pool entries were keyed by SHA-256 but did not record when, by which run, from which version and commit they were made, and some recorded no output hash
- CHIM-COLLISION-UNION-FAIL-NOT-CACHED-48 (no report page): A collision union that fails is compiled again for every room that uses the same mesh packet
- [CHIM-INTERIORS-REUSE-MISS-48](CHIM-INTERIORS-REUSE-MISS-48.md): The CHIM rooms stage (chim-interiors) is never reused: it hashed the shared CHIM unit cache, which is past the 512 MiB folder limit
- [CHIMPORT-NO-SHARED-POOL-35](CHIMPORT-NO-SHARED-POOL-35.md): The CHIMporter kept its own unit store beside the shared hashed storage pool: no pool flag, every run folder a private copy
- [CHIMPORT-POOL-CROSS-MOUNT-36](CHIMPORT-POOL-CROSS-MOUNT-36.md): CHIMport run folder and the storage pool on two mounts of one volume: hard links fail across the mounts, so pooled units were copied, not linked
- [CHIMPORT-RETRY-AUDIT-FAILED-36](CHIMPORT-RETRY-AUDIT-FAILED-36.md): CHIMport --retry-failed never reran cells that converted but failed an audit (memory fit, doors, hull chains): the runner marks them done
- DOOR-CHECK-KNOWN-UNKEYED-54 (no report page): config/door-check-known.json is in no stage key: an edit to the known list never re-runs a passed image's door check
- [MWAD-WALK-ORDER-35](MWAD-WALK-ORDER-35.md): Input check results depend on directory listing order
