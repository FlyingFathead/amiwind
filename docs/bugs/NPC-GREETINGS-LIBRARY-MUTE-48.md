## Status: 23 October 2026

Fixed in source on the v0.0.48 line (branch v0.0.48-npc-greetings), not yet in a build or seen in game: the
[NPC voice table](../NPC_VOICE_TABLE.md).

## Symptom

The maintainer, 23 October 2026: the NPC greetings should be as they are per NPC, which needs a really fast lookup
table, and later he had not heard all of those NPCs use their typical vocabulary.

- The actor library (`tools/npc_library.py`) gives every NPC it places empty greeting fields (`aw_voice` and
  `aw_line` empty, hello distance 0). That covers the 468 outdoor region actors (`--chim-region-actors`, on by
  default): none of them ever greeted, and a talk with one did nothing.
- Town residents said one Hello line (picked at build time with a fixed disposition) and at most 12 Idle, Hit,
  Attack and Flee lines per model, and lines with conditions the builder could not decide were dropped.

## Where

`tools/npc_library.py` `entity_text`; the engine had no way to find an NPC's lines by its record
(`engine/aga/src/aw_anim.c` read the lines from each model's layout only).

## How it happened

The library was built for models and placements first (CHIM-EXTERIOR-ACTORS-MISSING-46); its docstring said voices and
dialogue were not made there. The town residents' greeting path converts a voice per resident in the town stages,
which the library never runs.

## Fix

- `tools/greeting_lut.py` (an image step, cached on its inputs) writes `id1/npc-voices.lut` (AWGL1): every NPC record's
  Hello, Idle, Intruder, Thief, Hit, Attack and Flee lines and its conversation greeting, with the original's filter
  (`src/mwad/dialogue.py` Context.compile, the town residents' rule) decided at build time where it reads only the
  speaker's record, and the rest as 8-byte condition records.
- `engine/aga/src/aw_glut.c` looks the record up by `aw_source_id` (binary search, cached per actor), says the Hello of
  an NPC without its own, opens a talk with the table's conversation greeting, and gives every NPC (town residents
  too) its Idle, Hit, Attack and Flee lines. `aw_npc_voice_lut 0` keeps the previous method.
- The sounds are the media stage's converted voices: 4,224 files, 4,223 already in a full build's payload (the
  missing one has no source in the game data).

## Verification so far

- `tests/test_greeting_lut.py`: synthetic records (race and sex voices, an id-specific line, a faction line, a
  disposition and a Random100 condition left for run time, journal and TalkedToPc greetings); every NPC's lines equal
  what the filter lets it say; the native engine code (`tests/aga_glut_test.c`) picks what the reference picks for
  every NPC, topic and state, and the engine glue gives a library NPC its hello distance, line and voice.
- On the game data: 2,673 NPC records, 757,205 bytes (450,216 kept in memory).

## Next

Intruder and Thief need their engine events (crime witnesses); the conditions on the player's sex, race, attributes
and the weather fail until the engine knows them; disposition is the record's base value until disposition
modifiers exist. A boot smoke and an in-game check of an outdoor actor's greeting are still to do.

- ACTOR-ANNOTATE-ROOM-REFERENCE-48 (no report page): The image step stopped on a room corpse: its actor annotation looked up the support class by id alone, but room actors are classified by reference
- [ACTOR-BAKE-CENTRE-SEAM-48](ACTOR-BAKE-CENTRE-SEAM-48.md): Bradil Elarven (Glassworker's Hall) left unbaked: his centre probe falls through the seam of two floor pieces
- ACTOR-GROUND-BAKE-CHIM-ROOMS-48 (no report page): The image step stopped in the actor ground bake: it loaded the batch-room shell maps as classic collision scenes, and its error named no map
- [ACTOR-LEVELLED-NO-WANDER-56](ACTOR-LEVELLED-NO-WANDER-56.md): Levelled creatures (most wild creatures) never wander or aggro: the Wander table held placed actors only
- [ACTOR-SPAWN-DROPTOFLOOR-49](ACTOR-SPAWN-DROPTOFLOOR-49.md): The resident spawn grounding as Quake's droptofloor, one rule with the build's room bake
- ACTOR-STATE-NOT-READ-ON-SPAWN-54 (no report page): A spawned actor never reads its actor record back: a killed NPC respawns alive and lowered health resets on re-entry or load
- [ACTOR-STATE-POOL-LIMITS-54](ACTOR-STATE-POOL-LIMITS-54.md): The actor record drops changes past 128 changed actors, 12 item changes or 8 spell changes per actor; package changes of the behaviour records and NPC positions are not saved
- ACTOR-STORM-POSE-51 (no report page): Requested: characters shield their eyes in ash and blight storms (the idlestorm pose), as all regular NPCs and the player do in the original, often seen in Ald'ruhn
- [ACTOR-WANDER-AGGRO-52](ACTOR-WANDER-AGGRO-52.md): Requested: NPCs and creatures wander, idle and aggro by their own record variables (AI packages, Fight), as the original game does
- AMBIENT-RESIDENTS-NOT-VISIBLE-54 (no report page): From the matched pose OpenMW shows four residents on the Seyda Neen square, AmiWind one far figure
