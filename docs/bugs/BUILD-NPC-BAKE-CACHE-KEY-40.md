## Status: 15 October 2026

Open in v0.0.40-dev2. Fixed in mutable source, not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

The complete source suite ran 4,179 tests with one failure, three platform skips
and three expected failures. The unchanged bake-import coverage guard reports
two missing cache dependencies: mesh_geometry and npc_anim.

## Where

tools/npc_lod.py BAKE_MODULES and code_identity; the new imports are in
tools/npc_geometry.py.

## How it happened

The component-preserving fallback reuses mesh component simplification and
animation size calculation. Its integration did not extend the resident-model
cache key to include those two source modules. A later edit to either helper
could therefore reuse stale model output.

## Why it was not caught

Focused geometry and animation tests did not include the existing cache-key
coverage guard. The complete source suite caught the omission.

## Reproduction

Run test_build_pool_arg.PoolKeyCoverageTests against the affected source.
The import coverage guard fails without changing any cache or model.

## Repair

Add both helper modules to BAKE_MODULES and the explicit source-module map in
code_identity. Extend the existing key-mutation control to verify each new
module actually changes the cache key. Keep the coverage guard unchanged.
No geometry, animation samples, budgets or atomic publication rules change.

## Verification

The failed suite's source and immutable input are unchanged and preserved.
Both direct missing dependencies were identified together. The unchanged coverage guard and actual key-mutation controls pass within
112 integrated checks, with zero failures, errors or skips and unchanged source.
The complete corrected-candidate gate remains pending. No native or package
acceptance is established.

## Prevention

Include the existing cache-key coverage test in affected validation whenever
a cached producer gains an import. Check the entire missing-module set rather
than addressing only the first dependency.


## Exact corrected-source suite: 15 October 2026

The corrected candidate completes 4,181 tests with zero unexpected failures
or errors. Three Windows-only skips and three tracked Census expected failures
remain explicit. Source and pin hashes are unchanged. This result does not
establish native or package acceptance.

## Bugs in the same category

Family: Build reuse keys and output attribution (`build-cache-reuse`). A unit is rebuilt only when the content hash of all its inputs changes or its output is missing or damaged. Keys never under-declare (a missed input allows a wrong reuse) and should not over-declare (a file no output depends on forces rebuilds); outputs carry no wall-clock values; every changed file is credited to the stage that wrote it. See [families](README.md#families).

- [BUILD-CACHE-OWNER-FAILS-STAGE-34](BUILD-CACHE-OWNER-FAILS-STAGE-34.md): A cache entry owned by another user failed a release build four minutes in, instead of being rebuilt or caught before any stage
- [BUILD-CELL-PROGRESS-KEY-BUGS-35](BUILD-CELL-PROGRESS-KEY-BUGS-35.md): Every bug registration stopped builds at the reuse preflight: the cell-progress key held all of docs/
- [BUILD-CHIM-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-35](BUILD-CHIM-KEY-UNDERDECLARED-35.md): The CHIM stage's fingerprint left out the tracker code it ran (8 files, 2 functions): a wrong-reuse risk
- [BUILD-DIAGNOSTIC-INPUT-REFUSED-36](BUILD-DIAGNOSTIC-INPUT-REFUSED-36.md): The cell-progress stage was never reusable: it reads the CHIM stage's statistics report, which counted as a forbidden diagnostic read
- [BUILD-ENGINE-KEY-SDK-33](BUILD-ENGINE-KEY-SDK-33.md): The engine stage is never reused: the Amiga SDK is not part of its key
- [BUILD-FLORA-RECEIPT-SECONDS-36](BUILD-FLORA-RECEIPT-SECONDS-36.md): The world flora receipt held the stage's wall time, so a rerun with the same inputs never wrote the same receipt
- [BUILD-GALLERY-JSON-KEY-ORDER-35](BUILD-GALLERY-JSON-KEY-ORDER-35.md): NPC gallery outputs differed between two builds only in JSON key order (cache vs fresh results)
- [BUILD-IMAGE-NO-RESUME-33](BUILD-IMAGE-NO-RESUME-33.md): A late failure in the image step reruns the whole image step, and the failing check could have run in its first seconds
- [BUILD-IMAGE-STALE-PYTHONPATH-35](BUILD-IMAGE-STALE-PYTHONPATH-35.md): Builder container images put an old builder copy on PYTHONPATH
- [BUILD-KEY-FUNCTION-DEFAULTS-TOP-36](BUILD-KEY-FUNCTION-DEFAULTS-TOP-36.md): Adding a function to a shared module changed the key of every stage that imports it, although no stage runs the new code
- [BUILD-KEY-OVERBROAD-33](BUILD-KEY-OVERBROAD-33.md): A new bug page or release file list change rebuilds interior, census, harvest and the CHIM stages: an import search path counted as a read of every file under tools/
- [BUILD-OUTPUTS-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33](BUILD-OUTPUTS-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33.md): A stage that runs again never matches its old outputs (tool logs, timings, run paths), so every stage after it is rebuilt
- [BUILD-PASS-KEY-OVERBROAD-36](BUILD-PASS-KEY-OVERBROAD-36.md): Image-pass and unit cache keys changed with code no pass runs: a new function in a shared module and edits to the cache's own key code rekeyed every character head preview twice (Vivec stage A try2 and try3: 275 of 275 recomputed)
- [BUILD-PASS-KEY-RULE-NO-CARRYOVER-36](BUILD-PASS-KEY-RULE-NO-CARRYOVER-36.md): A pass key rule change carried no entries written by older trees: dev4 recomputed 2,372 optimizer maps and the exterior sky maps with code and outputs identical to dev3
- [BUILD-POOL-APPLY-READ-MISS-35](BUILD-POOL-APPLY-READ-MISS-35.md): In a pool-mode build every reused stage was refused as the next reuse source: the reuse step's read of tools/storage_pool.py counted as a stage input
- [BUILD-POOL-ARG-UNFINGERPRINTED-35](BUILD-POOL-ARG-UNFINGERPRINTED-35.md): The balmora stage was never reusable once the shared storage pool grew past 512 MiB: its --npc-model-pool folder was hashed as an input
- [BUILD-POOL-READONLY-SCENE-WRITE-35](BUILD-POOL-READONLY-SCENE-WRITE-35.md): A pool-mode resume failed in 17 s: npcs could not rewrite its copy of seyda.bsp (copytree kept the pool's read-only mode)
- [BUILD-RESUME-HAZARD-STATIC-35](BUILD-RESUME-HAZARD-STATIC-35.md): A resume failed in 'area': the rebuild hazard counted files of a reused stage that had run again after all
- [BUILD-RESUME-OUTPUTS-DIFFER-35](BUILD-RESUME-OUTPUTS-DIFFER-35.md): Every v0.0.35 resume refused the stages after a rerun scene-chain stage as 'outputs differ' without comparing them
- [BUILD-REUSE-ATTRIBUTION-33](BUILD-REUSE-ATTRIBUTION-33.md): Two stages that ran at the same time were both refused reuse when one wrote files under a folder the other only reads
- [BUILD-REUSE-AUDIT-WITHOUT-REASON-36](BUILD-REUSE-AUDIT-WITHOUT-REASON-36.md): The reuse audit and preflight called a stage rerun because its old record was short a replaced file UNEXPECTED, although the reason explains it
- [BUILD-REUSE-CASCADE-36](BUILD-REUSE-CASCADE-36.md): A fix in CHIM-native town code made 23 of 36 stages rebuild: the interior stage reran with different outputs and 5 rebuilds were unexpected
- [BUILD-REUSE-CUTOFF-MODE-36](BUILD-REUSE-CUTOFF-MODE-36.md): Early cutoff compared file modes with their write bits: a stage reused by hard link (read-only) never matched the same bytes written fresh, so 10 stages after dev3's bsp rerun were refused
- [BUILD-REUSE-PLAN-ENV-36](BUILD-REUSE-PLAN-ENV-36.md): The standalone reuse plan reports environment changes the real build does not have
- [BUILD-REUSE-RECORD-RETIRED-36](BUILD-REUSE-RECORD-RETIRED-36.md): Early cutoff and the reuse audit lost their records when an older run was retired: stages with byte-identical outputs counted as changed
- [BUILD-REUSE-REDUCED-RECORD-36](BUILD-REUSE-REDUCED-RECORD-36.md): A stage reused from a run that had itself reused it came back without the files a later stage replaced there, so that later stage failed when it ran again
- [BUILD-REUSE-SCRATCH-UNDECLARED-33](BUILD-REUSE-SCRATCH-UNDECLARED-33.md): A rerun with --reuse-from reused 1 of 33 stages: the builder's scratch folder made the first stages non-reusable
- [BUILD-SCENE-DIAGNOSTIC-COPY-35](BUILD-SCENE-DIAGNOSTIC-COPY-35.md): Scene-chain stages were never reusable: copying the previous scene (logs included) counted as reading another stage's diagnostics
- [BUILD-SCHEDULER-TABLE-KEY-35](BUILD-SCHEDULER-TABLE-KEY-35.md): A new row in the build scheduler's stage table rebuilds stages that never read it: the table counted as import-time code of every stage
- [BUILD-SEYDA-BOUNDED-RUN-PATHS-36](BUILD-SEYDA-BOUNDED-RUN-PATHS-36.md): The actor-contact stage wrote its run folder path into 67 Seyda Neen region records, so its outputs differed in every run folder
- [BUILD-STAIR-KEY-BOOKKEEPING-36](BUILD-STAIR-KEY-BOOKKEEPING-36.md): Stair walk keys count the progress lines (stair_progress.py) and the record bookkeeping (stair_records.py): an edit to either rekeys every walk
- [BUILD-SURVEY-KEY-CONFIG-35](BUILD-SURVEY-KEY-CONFIG-35.md): World survey, world terrain, world UI and CHIM stage keys counted every file under config/: a path built from a loop name read as the whole folder
- [BUILD-SURVEY-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33](BUILD-SURVEY-NOT-REPRODUCIBLE-33.md): The world-survey stage writes its wall time into its outputs, so a rerun never has the same outputs
- [CACHE-NO-PROVENANCE-36](CACHE-NO-PROVENANCE-36.md): Cache and pool entries were keyed by SHA-256 but did not record when, by which run, from which version and commit they were made, and some recorded no output hash
- [CHIMPORT-NO-SHARED-POOL-35](CHIMPORT-NO-SHARED-POOL-35.md): The CHIMporter kept its own unit store beside the shared hashed storage pool: no pool flag, every run folder a private copy
- [CHIMPORT-POOL-CROSS-MOUNT-36](CHIMPORT-POOL-CROSS-MOUNT-36.md): CHIMport run folder and the storage pool on two mounts of one volume: hard links fail across the mounts, so pooled units were copied, not linked
- [CHIMPORT-RETRY-AUDIT-FAILED-36](CHIMPORT-RETRY-AUDIT-FAILED-36.md): CHIMport --retry-failed never reran cells that converted but failed an audit (memory fit, doors, hull chains): the runner marks them done
- [MWAD-WALK-ORDER-35](MWAD-WALK-ORDER-35.md): Input check results depend on directory listing order
