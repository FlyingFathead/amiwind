## Status: 9 October 2026

Open. Present in the v0.0.32 release gallery. Found by the file-by-file comparison of the gallery
built from parts with the gallery built whole ([MODULAR_NPCS.md](../MODULAR_NPCS.md)).

## Symptom

Gallery model `m733c45e63ae7480a` (whole bake, 638 faces): its reduced vertices reach x = 16
Quake units while the source appearance spans x = -3.85 to 4.07. The same appearance composed from
parts (the same faces, baked part by part without the gallery's pre-bake translation) stays within
the source bounds (x up to 3.92).

## Where

`tools/npc_geometry.py`, `simplify_shape` / `bake` (fast_simplification on one shape of that
outfit). Only this model of 3,500 humanoid gallery models differs from its parts version by more
than 0.85 units. Residents and town imports have not been checked for spikes yet.

## How it happened

Unknown in detail: the simplifier places a collapsed vertex far off the surface for this shape in
the translated frame the gallery bakes in; the untranslated part bake does not.

## Why it was not caught

No check compared reduced bounds with source bounds; budget audits count faces and vertices only.

## Reproduction

`tools/npc_parts_compare.py --candidate <parts gallery> --reference <whole gallery>`: the model
with the largest `bounds` difference.

## Repair

None yet. Candidate: a bounds check in the baker (reduced vertices must stay within the source
bounds plus a margin) with a retry, plus the same check in the gallery audit.

## Verification

None yet.

## Prevention

Planned: the bounds check above as a gate on every NPC model.

Family: Mesh converter geometry (`converter-geometry`). Converted faces must be planar, wound to their plane, non-degenerate and within engine ranges; checked by the face validator. See [families](README.md#families).
