## Symptom

With the debug HUD on, the weapon box under the stat bars is half covered by a black rectangle and the magic box
beside it is hidden but for its top edge (maintainer frame, v0.0.42-dev1, Vivec entrance, 17 October 2026).

## Where

`engine/aga/src/aw_hud.c`, `Sbar_Draw`: `Draw_Fill(88, vid.height-18, vid.width-88, 18, 255)` behind the GLOBAL/LOCAL
XYZ rows, and the rows themselves right-aligned with room down to x = 88.

## How it happened

The strip was laid out when the HUD had only the three stat bars (x 8..83). The original weapon and magic boxes
(HUD-STATS-29, aw_icons.c at x 85..127; the placeholder marks at x 88..140) came later and sit exactly where the
strip starts. The fill is drawn after the boxes, so it blacks out their lower part; a long LOCAL row also ran into
the magic box.

## Why it was not caught

The HUD native test fixed the strip at x = 88 and did not know about the boxes.

## Reproduction

`dbg hud on` (or `dbg overlay on`) in any exterior, look at the boxes right of the stat bars.

## Repair

The coordinate rows and their fill start right of the boxes (x 144). A cell or cheat readout that no longer fits
either row goes on the row above them (shared with the INSPECT hint, INSPECT-OVER-VIEWPORT-42; the compass owns
that row when it is on). The "WASD / F10 console" hint moved to the same column.

## Verification

`tests/aga_hud_test.c`: every fill under the view starts at x 144, every right-column string stays at x >= 144;
the dev1 frame's numbers (LOCAL -4353 3015 146) put the cell on the row above. In game: pending a MiniWind frame.

## Prevention

The test asserts the column start; the boxes' positions are named next to the constant (`HUD_RIGHT_X`).
