## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.33-companion, not shipped at the time of writing.

## Symptom

None seen in play. A scripted actor (an escort or the debug companion) that took its step before the
player in a frame would have loaded the CHIM chunk ring around the actor instead of the player for
that frame.

## Where

`AW_ActorStep` in `engine/aga/src/aw_walk.c` moves an actor with the player's own walk
(`AW_WalkPlayer`), and `AW_WalkPlayer` starts by loading the CHIM ring around the position it moves.

## How it happened

The ring loader was added to the player's walk; actors reuse that walk for the player's stair and
slide behaviour, so they called the loader too. The ring ticks once per frame, so whichever walker
came first in a frame decided where the ring was centred.

## Why it was not caught

Today the player always moves first (the server physics runs the player before the escorts and the
companion), so the ring stayed on the player. Found by reading the code while adding the NPC
companion test.

## Reproduction

Not reproducible in play with the current order; an actor stepping before the player in a frame
would show it.

## Repair

`AW_ActorStep` clears the ring hook around the actor's walk and restores it afterwards: only the
player moves the ring.

## Verification

`tests/test_companion_native.py` (`test_actor_steps_leave_the_chim_ring_to_the_player`) checks the
order in the source; the companion and escort host tests still pass.

## Prevention

The regression test above; actor movement keeps using the player's walk, without its side effects.

Family: CHIM world streamer (`chim-streamer`). The CHIM streamer keeps Quake's visibility effective and its renderer counters must not get worse. See [families](README.md#families).
