# STAIR-FLIGHT-CORE-SPLIT-41: The stair gate marks flights per 1024-unit core: a flight that crosses a core line loses its flight mark, so its failures do not stop a build

## Symptom
On the v0.0.41 final CHIM world, 39 of the 5,646 flight steps lose their flight mark when the steps are found core
by core, as the gate does, instead of on the whole frame: Balmora 11, Vivec 10, the others in region frames. A step
without its flight mark is advisory: if it could not be walked, the build would not stop.

## Where
`tools/stair_walk.py` `candidates` and `flights`, called on one core at a time (`chim.collision.stair_task`; the
legacy maps' walk uses cores the same way). `flights` needs three steps of one placement in a row; the steps of
the next core are not there.

## How it happened
The cores were introduced to spread the walk over the workers (a step is tested in the core holding its riser
point). The flight test was kept per core, so a flight whose steps lie in two cores is two short runs.

## Why it was not caught
The gate's rows were only compared with the gate's own earlier rows, never with a whole-frame search. Found while
measuring BUILD-STAIR-WALK-BORDER-COPIES-41 (each step's flight mark found per core and on the whole frame).

## Reproduction
For each frame: `candidates` on every core of `chim.collision.stair_tasks` against `candidates(polys, None)`; count
the flight steps whose mark is missing per core. v0.0.41 final world: 39 (frames x-03/y-02, x+04/y-12, x-08/y-05,
x-08/y-04, x-07/y-04, x-07/y-05, x+12/y+04, x+13/y+04 among them).

## Repair
On the v0.0.42 line (branch v0.0.42-stairs2): `stair_walk.candidates` finds a core's steps on the core plus
`stair_walk.FLIGHT_MARGIN` (128 units), marks the flights on all of them and keeps only the core's own steps;
`chim.collision.stair_polys` gives the CHIM walkers (and the progress count) the polygons that far out. The legacy
maps' walk gets it the same way (their polygons are the whole map). It changed the walker's code, so every frame
was walked once more.

## Verification
v0.0.41 final world, flight marks per core against the whole frame: 39 lost -> 0 lost, 0 gained (5,646 flight
steps). A full stair walk of that world with the new walker: 726 frames, all passed.

## Prevention
`tests/test_stair_flight_margin.py`: a flight across a core line keeps its marks in both cores as on the whole map,
and with the margin 0 (the method before) it loses them.

Family: Collision shapes and climbing (stairs, ramps, walkways) (`stairs-collision`). Convex collision proxies invent steep faces or bury authored surfaces; Morrowind collides with authored geometry (step up 34 units, slope up to 46 degrees).
