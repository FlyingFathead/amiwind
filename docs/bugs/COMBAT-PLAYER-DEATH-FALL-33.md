## Status: 9 October 2026

Open (owner playtest).

## Symptom

When the player dies the view does not fall to the ground as in Morrowind.

## Where

engine/aga/src/aw_combat.c (player death view), QuakeC player death.

## How it happened

Sources: OpenMW CharacterController::playRandomDeath switches the player to third person (World::useDeathCamera) and plays the body's death animation, because the first-person animations have no death. AmiWind has no third-person player body; the knockdown already lowers the view to the floor (player_down_view), but death does not use it.

## Why it was not caught

The knockdown view was written for knockdown and knockout only.

## Reproduction

Always.

## Repair

Not yet: on death, lower the view along the death fall and hold it (the knockdown view, without getting up), until the death screen; a third-person body view only if a player model exists later.

## Verification

None yet: the view height at death follows the fall and stays down (fixture), plus a clip.

## Prevention

Combat and death behaviour follow the original rules with the source named (OpenMW source, game settings); every presentation change gets a fixture or an in-game clip.
