## Status: 9 October 2026

Repaired in source on the v0.0.35 builder-performance line (not shipped): the same rows, byte for
byte, for about a quarter of the processor time.

## Symptom

In the v0.0.33-rc1c build the stair walk took 1,751 s of the image step's 3,099 s (14,645
processor-seconds, 8.4 cores of 22 on a busy host), the longest pass of the build.

## Where

`tools/stair_walk.py` (`Collision`, `Headroom`, `check`), `tools/audit_walkability.py`
(`Scene.trace`).

## How it happened

Measured on the heaviest open-world map (vf1366, 2,591 rows): 78 % of the time was the interpreted
collision trace, where every dot product went through a generator and `sum()`, and every trace
tested every placement's bounds in a Python loop; most of the rest was the headroom test, which
computed against every visible triangle of the map for each point and box. The pass handed maps out
in name order, so a large map dispatched late kept one worker busy after the others had finished.

The walk covers 614,745 rows in the rc1c image: 516,164 ramps, 98,143 single steps and 438 flight
steps; only the flight steps can fail the build.

## Why it was not caught

The pass grew with the payload (the open world added hundreds of thousands of ramps) and its cost
was not timed separately until the build profile's section timers.

## Reproduction

Any full image build: the profile section `parallel map: check_map_cached`.

## Repair

Same arithmetic in the same order, without the overhead: the trace inlines its products (every dot
product is `0. + x0*y0 + x1*y1 + x2*y2`, as `sum()` computes it); a plan-view grid lists the
placements whose bounds a trace's segment can touch, tested in their original order with the same
comparisons; a plan-view grid of the visible triangles serves the headroom tests, again in their
original order; maps are handed out largest first while the rows come back in map order. The
original trace and box filter stay in the code as the references the tests compare against.

## Verification

48 maps of the rc1c image (every CHIM frame map, the two largest interiors and 40 random others;
15,506 rows), old and new code side by side on the same host: identical rows, byte for byte, and
737 against 201 processor-seconds (3.67 times less). `tests/test_walk_trace_speed.py` compares the
new trace, box filter and headroom tests with the reference code over thousands of random segments
and points, and whole-map rows with and without the new code.

## Prevention

The builder profile reports every image-step section with its processor time and cores; a pass
whose cost grows with the payload is a fix item (docs/performance/BUILDER_PROFILE.md).
