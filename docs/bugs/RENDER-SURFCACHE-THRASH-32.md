_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.43-dev3 (18 October 2026)._

## Status: 8 October 2026

Open. Found by the renderer counters work (branch v0.0.32-counters, not yet merged).

## Symptom

With the camera standing still, Seyda Neen 1 allocates 914 surface cache blocks per frame
(812 KB, 0.76 million texels drawn), Seyda Neen 3 625. Balmora allocates 0 at its cameras.
The cache is smaller than these views need, so lit surfaces are rebuilt every frame.

## Where

Engine surface cache (`d_surf.c`, cache size set at start-up).

## How it happened

Unknown: likely many distinct lit brush-model surfaces in view at once.

## Why it was not caught

No per-frame cache counters before this work.

## Reproduction

`dbg rcount 1` at the Seyda Neen cameras in `docs/HARDWARE-BENCHMARK.md`.

## Repair

Not yet: measure cache size needed per view; compare with the memory budget.

## Verification

Pending.

## Prevention

Counters in the benchmark route.

Family: Rendering cost and visibility (`render-performance`). Read the visibility data and renderer counters before any performance claim. See [families](README.md#families).

- AW-20260928-07 (no report page): Slow opening exterior / excessive residency
- [CHIM-SLOWCPU-FRAMETIME-33](CHIM-SLOWCPU-FRAMETIME-33.md): Balmora on CHIM runs at about 1 frame per second on a slow 68040 (cycle-exact emulation)
- [CHIM-TRACE-TAIL-33](CHIM-TRACE-TAIL-33.md): A few CHIM collision traces visit thousands of clipnodes
- DEMOWIND-54 (no report page): Requested: DemoWind, a small fullscreen AGA build with only cheap animated effects, browsed one by one
- [ENGINE-C2P-ROWSTRIDE-35](ENGINE-C2P-ROWSTRIDE-35.md): The display conversion ignored the bitmap row stride: a screen whose rows are padded for the fetch mode rendered skewed
- [ENGINE-CEILF-PER-EDGE-36](ENGINE-CEILF-PER-EDGE-36.md): R_EmitEdge calls the C library ceil twice per edge
- [ENGINE-DEAD-FIXEDPOINT-GRADIENTS-36](ENGINE-DEAD-FIXEDPOINT-GRADIENTS-36.md): The 68040 build converts every drawn surface's gradients to fixed point that nothing reads
- [ENGINE-FLOATTIME-DIV64-35](ENGINE-FLOATTIME-DIV64-35.md): Sys_FloatTime made two 64-bit library divisions per call to build seconds and microseconds
- [ENGINE-FPCR-DANCE-36](ENGINE-FPCR-DANCE-36.md): Every float-to-int conversion in the engine saves, changes and restores the FPU control register
- ENGINE-RTG-SLOW-PATH-52 (no report page): With a graphics card installed the engine picks an RTG screen, then draws it through the slow generic path: the direct CyberGraphX copy is switched off
- [ENGINE-UPSTREAM-ASM-UNUSED-36](ENGINE-UPSTREAM-ASM-UNUSED-36.md): The engine is built without AmiQuake's 68k assembly: spans, fixed point and maths run as C at -O1
- [ENGINE-UPSTREAM-SPANS8-SPRITE-LOOP-36](ENGINE-UPSTREAM-SPANS8-SPRITE-LOOP-36.md): Upstream AmiQuake's assembly D_DrawSpans8 has the shape of the sprite span loop; it never runs at the default d_subdiv16 1
- [ENGINE-VID-UPDATE-FIRST-RECT-35](ENGINE-VID-UPDATE-FIRST-RECT-35.md): VID_Update converted only the first rectangle of the update list
- [INTERIOR-FAR-BLANK-MANOR-56](INTERIOR-FAR-BLANK-MANOR-56.md): In Ald'ruhn's Manor District the far parts appear as blank spots instead of fading into dark grey, and the room is slow
- [INTERIOR-MORAG-TONG-FPS-43](INTERIOR-MORAG-TONG-FPS-43.md): The Morag Tong Guild interior runs at a very low frame rate
- MODAL-WORLD-29 (no report page): Head/race and journal backgrounds consume world work
- [NPC-TARGET-REDUNDANT-31](NPC-TARGET-REDUNDANT-31.md): NPC targeting runs 2-4 times per frame and checks every NPC
- [PERF-ARENA-PIT-SLOW-48](PERF-ARENA-PIT-SLOW-48.md): The Vivec Arena Pit runs slowly: a large interior with heavy drawn and collision geometry
- [PRISON-SHIP-RENDER-COST-56](PRISON-SHIP-RENDER-COST-56.md): The prison ship's hold draws slower than the Vivec Arena Pit: frame rate dips in the opening room
- [RENDER-BMODEL-FRAGMENTS-32](RENDER-BMODEL-FRAGMENTS-32.md): Brush models spanning many terrain leaves are clipped face by face down the terrain BSP
- [RENDER-EDGECACHE-SEYDA-32](RENDER-EDGECACHE-SEYDA-32.md): No edges are reused between frames in Seyda Neen views
- SKEL-16MB-TRAP-52 (no report page): With skeletal actors the game stops loading Balmora at 16 MB of Fast RAM with a software failure (error 80000027); the baked build loads
- SKEL-RUNTIME-COST-52 (no report page): The skeletal prototype poses every vertex twice a drawn frame, with three divisions and three float-to-integer conversions each: it must cost what a baked frame costs
- [SPRITE-BAD-TYPE-THREADED-56](SPRITE-BAD-TYPE-THREADED-56.md): R_DrawSprite: Bad sprite type ends a load (dbg aw hors 0) on Amiberry with the threaded CPU: the game stays on Loading
- [TOWN-VIS-OCCLUSION-31](TOWN-VIS-OCCLUSION-31.md): Converted buildings, rooms and rocks do not block Quake visibility (func_wall)
