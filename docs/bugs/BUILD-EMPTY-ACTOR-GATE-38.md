_Last updated with AmiWind v0.0.41 (16 October 2026)._

## Symptom

The lava-pools image stops with No actor placements found, although its original exterior contains no NPC residents. Five leveled-creature spawn markers remain unconverted gameplay coverage.

## Where

Image actor-contact gate at source 296a389, after CHIM conversion and town packaging.

## How it happened

The contact gate treats every empty image as lost actor content. That is correct for ordinary scenes but does not represent an intentionally resident-free diagnostic exterior.

## Why it was not caught

Earlier MiniWind scenes had residents. The new exterior first reached this check after its empty resident packaging was repaired.

## Reproduction

Build the lava-pools preset at 296a389. The failed contact receipt has zero placements and one missing-actors error.

## Repair

For an exterior-only MiniWind with one matching CHIM town and no other scene BSPs, inspect original master placements against the configured frame. Any original NPC, direct creature or unresolved object prevents the empty-scene evidence. Leveled-creature markers are recorded individually as unconverted coverage, never supported actors. Only the sole empty-actor error becomes not-applicable, with master hash and scope recorded. Production actor acceptance stays false. All other contact errors and ordinary builds remain fail-closed. No engine mechanism changes.

## Verification

Regression covers the original actor census, normal/full scope refusal, empty audit output and invalid actor rejection. The prior candidate passed its source gate but correctly refused image creation upon finding five leveled-creature markers. Refined candidate image and native checks remain pending.

## Prevention

Keep missing-content failures distinct from source-proven absence; do not infer absence from a baked resident list alone.

Family: Gates, CI and tests (`tests-ci`). A check that is skipped, tests the wrong tree or depends on the host is not a check; skips fail loudly. See [families](README.md#families).
