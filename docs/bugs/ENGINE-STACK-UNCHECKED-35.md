# ENGINE-STACK-UNCHECKED-35: The engine never checked the stack it was started with; the pak directory alone needs 128 KiB

## Status: 10 October 2026

Fixed in source on the v0.0.35 line; ships with v0.0.35.

## Symptom

Started with a small stack (for example without the boot disk's Stack command), the engine overwrote memory below its stack instead of stopping.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/sys_amiga.c main`.

## How it happened

The pak loader keeps its 128 KiB directory on the stack and nothing compared that with the stack the program received.

## Why it was not caught

The engine came from the original sources, where these paths assumed well-formed input; no test fed them bad or unusual values.

## Reproduction

Found by reading the source (v0.0.35 engine review).

## Repair

Before anything else, main() compares the program's stack (tc_SPUpper - tc_SPLower of its task, set by both the shell and Workbench start-up) with a 256 KiB minimum and, when it is smaller, prints how much it needs and to run "Stack 300000" first, then exits.

## Verification

Source checks: the check runs first in main(), uses the task's stack bounds, and its minimum stays above the pak directory and below the boot disk's Stack value.

## Prevention

Untrusted input and unusual values are checked where they enter the engine; each fix has a regression check.
