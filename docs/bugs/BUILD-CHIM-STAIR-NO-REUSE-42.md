## Symptom
The v0.0.42 final's stair gate: "1118 frames walked, 0 reused; why walked: 494 its stored walk has no check mark of
a passed master build, 392 no earlier walk of this frame in the pool, and the rest inputs changed: 1 to 134 of their
parts".

## Where
The stair-walk records (`tools/stair_records.py`, `tools/chim/collision.py` walk_reuse_rule): release candidates and
finals reuse a walk only with the check mark that `stair_records.py promote` writes after a passed build of the
master builder.

## How it happened
- 494 frames: the passed v0.0.42-dev1 proof build reused 724 frame walks as passes of an earlier, failed dev1
  attempt (2026_10_17_v0.0.42-dev1_full-dev1-proof_e5b0c0c; the development rule: a pass is a pass) and walked none
  itself. `promote` marked only the records a run stored, never the ones it reused, and the run that stored them
  failed, so those passes could never get a check mark; a final reuses only checked walks. (Promoting the dev1
  proof run afterwards: 2,062 already marked, 0 new.) The launcher also never ran `promote` after a passed build;
  only the master builder's service did.
- 392 frames: new in this build (CHIMport batch 1).
- The rest: a real change. 562d991 (MESH-VIVEC-CAP-GAP-38) reduces 14 mushroom and parasol meshes with the
  boundary-locked reducer (1,317 placements); their walk lumps changed, and every chunk that places one changed its
  placement part (Azura's Coast, the east of Molag Amur, Vivec's surroundings). These walks must repeat.

## Why it was not caught
The launcher's runs passed every gate, so nobody looked at whether their walks became reusable; the build only says
why it walks once the stair gate starts.

## Reproduction
A final whose stair walks were last made by a launcher-started development build.

## Repair
- The stair gate's report lists the passes it reused (`pass_cache.reused_records`, the same form as the stored
  ones), and `promote` marks them after a passed build, only when the record is intact and unchanged since.
- The launcher promotes the stair-walk records of every passed build, as the master builder's service does
  (installed 17 October 2026).
- The v0.0.42 final's own 1,118 walks are promoted by its delivery, so the next build reuses every unchanged frame.

## Verification
Tests: `tests/test_stair_records.py` (a passed build that reused an unmarked pass marks it; a record written again
since is not marked), `tests/test_chim_stair_pass.py` (the gate lists the pass it reused). Pending: the next build
reuses the promoted walks of frames whose inputs did not change.

## Prevention
Every path that starts a build that can pass also runs the step that makes its results reusable.

- [BUILD-CACHE-PER-WORKSPACE-33](BUILD-CACHE-PER-WORKSPACE-33.md): Per-file caches live in each build workspace, so a build on a new volume with --reuse-from converts everything again (MiniWind media 1,195 s instead of seconds)
