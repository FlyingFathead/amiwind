## Symptom

The FS-UAE boot smoke boots the game, loads Seyda Neen, then travels to Balmora (`dbg tp -21800 -12300`). In two of
about five runs on 17-18 October 2026 the Balmora load printed its first steps (after the map, after the actors,
"Balmora") and then stayed on the Loading screen; the smoke reported "did not load a map (server seyda)". The same
image passed on a rerun each time.

Reproduced on 18 October 2026 with a repeat loop (below): five more hangs, four on the way to Balmora and one on the
way back to Seyda Neen. A hung load never finished: one hang was still there after 10 minutes.

## Where

Not in the map change itself. In all five hangs caught with the emulator's debugger, the game was waiting inside an
ordinary file call (an `open()` or a read during a model, sprite, inventory or combat-data load) for a request it had
handed to the file system of the game disk's boot partition (DH0, the Kickstart Fast File System on the emulator's
hard-file device), and the answer never came. Seen on two images: the v0.0.41-dev5 regional image (gate 2928,
17 October 2026) and the v0.0.43-dev1 build 2026_10_17_v0.0.43-dev1_full-batch2_7ac15b1.

## How it happened

What the debugger showed in each of the five hangs (12 of 12 program-counter samples, one per second, plus a walk of
every task's state and message port):

- The processor sat in Kickstart's idle loop (`$00F81476`, STOP): no task was running. This is a deadlock, not
  a slow load and not a loop in the engine: nothing was computing.
- The game process waited for the file-system reply signal (SIGF_DOS). Its own reply port was empty: no reply had
  arrived.
- The request packet on the game's stack was linked into the message list of DH0's port. The DH0 handler had
  taken it (its port was empty) and was asleep in its main wait, without answering. The world disk's handlers
  (DW0, DW1) and the remote-console folder (AWCTL) were idle and not involved.
- The engine call sites differed every time (a model load in the server's precache, a sprite, the inventory data,
  the combat data). The only thing in common was the file system of DH0.

So a file request to DH0 was taken and never completed below the engine: in the emulator's hard-file path (most
likely an I/O completion lost under host load) or inside the file system handler. This is the same class as the two
older freezes SEYDA-LOAD-HANG-30 (a read that never returns during a Seyda Neen load) and HANG-IDLE-DUSK-35 (the
music read that never returns). The engine stops reading music synchronously since v0.0.36, but every other file
call is still a normal blocking call.

Seyda Neen's full CHIM zone ("zone full ... retrying") and the low hunk gap when it is left are not the cause: the
hangs come with and without them (see Reproduction, 128 MiB).

## Why it was not caught

The boot smoke made one map change per run and passes most of the time, so single green runs hid it; the earlier
failure on the old image was taken for a flaky smoke and rerun. The hang needs a busy host: on a quiet host it did
not happen in 100 loads.

## Reproduction

Sometimes, and only with the host busy. Repeat loop (private hunt tool): fresh play copy, boot to the console, load
Seyda Neen, music off as in the smoke, then `dbg tp` Balmora / Seyda Neen back and forth, a load counted as hung
after 90 to 600 s, the debugger attached. All runs: the v0.0.43-dev1 image and engine (sha256 d9a21a39...), FS-UAE
3.1.66, JIT preset, 68040, 2 cores per session, 18 October 2026.

| Runs | Fast RAM | Host | Loads | Hangs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 sessions, 6 s per map | 16 MiB | quiet | 48 | 0 |
| 3 sessions, 6 s per map | 128 MiB (95 MiB CHIM cache, no "zone full") | quiet | 48 | 0 |
| 3 sessions, 20 s per map | 16 MiB | CPU + disk load beside it | 22 | 1 |
| 5 sessions, 15 s per map | 16 MiB | CPU + disk load | 100 | 0 |
| 6 sessions, 3 s per map | 16 MiB | CPU + disk load, play copies prepared and removed beside it | 239 | 4 |
| 9 sessions, 3 s per map (hard-file device, A/B) | 16 MiB | CPU load, then disk load | 720 | 0 |
| 9 sessions, 3 s per map (boot disk on the emulated IDE port, A/B) | 16 MiB | the same | 550 | 0 |

Six unmodified boot smokes beside the loaded loop all passed. All five hangs came in two windows in which several
play copies (2.2 GB each) were being copied into or removed from the Docker volume beside the running sessions, as
in the two original failures (a test-suite container, a source package build). A steady synthetic load (busy
processors, repeated 1.6 GB writes) did not bring them back, so the hard-file versus IDE comparison could not
decide at this rate.

## Repair

Open: an emulator disk stall during heavy host write bursts, under observation. Real hardware is not believed to be
affected (it has no host-side hard-file path), but this is not proven. Next:
1. On the next capture, read the DH0 handler's pending device request and the emulator's hard-file queue to name
   the layer that loses it (emulator hard-file device or the file system).
2. Find a trigger that brings it back on demand (several 2 GB play copies written and deleted on the Docker disk
   while sessions run), then repeat the hard-file versus IDE A/B with it.
3. Then decide: the emulated IDE port for the boot disk in the shipped FS-UAE and WinUAE presets, a newer emulator,
   or a bounded wait in the engine's own file reads (the music reader's pattern, aw_aread.c) for map loads.

## Verification

Pending: needs the repair. A repair is verified by the repeat loop with the same I/O bursts: many loads with no
hang, where the unrepaired setup hangs.

## Prevention

The boot smoke (`tools/engine_smoke.py`) now:
- runs its map change three times (`--repeat`, default 3, back to the first map in between), so an intermittent
  load hang has three chances to show up in every smoke instead of one;
- runs FS-UAE with its monitor on a pseudo-terminal and, when a load does not finish, examines it in place
  (`stall.py`: five program-counter samples one second apart, exec's task lists, the game's waiting request). The
  stall described above is reported as "emulator disk stall (CHIM-SEYDA-BALMORA-LOAD-HANG-43)" and the run is
  retried once on a fresh play copy; a second stall fails the smoke. Any other stall fails at once with what the
  monitor saw.

Checked in the emulator, 18 October 2026, on the v0.0.43-dev1 image: the smoke passed with its map change run three
times (105 s); a smoke asked to load a map that does not exist stopped with "STALL unknown: pc 0 of 5 samples in exec
idle; game not in a file call" (the monitor check ran live and did not mistake a missing map for a disk stall).

Fly-cam check, 18 October 2026: noclip flight Seyda Neen -> Vivec -> Balmora -> Khuul with the music on
(about 300,000 units, 38 to 40 map and frame changes, about 290 s, under 3 times walking speed), at 16 MiB and at
128 MiB Fast RAM on a quiet host: both completed, no stall. At 16 MiB, 267 "zone full" lines and 12 hunk-gap
warnings; at 128 MiB, no "zone full" and the same 12 warnings.
