## Status: 9 October 2026

Open (a design limit of the first combat layer). Found while building the Vivec Arena minigame
(docs/COMBAT.md). The minigame itself is unaffected: its session restores the captured game.

## Symptom

Hit a resident in normal play and save during the fight: after loading, nobody is hostile. Kill a
resident, save and load: it stands again with its saved health.

## Where

`engine/aga/src/aw_combat.c` keeps the hostile NPCs in four fixed slots that the save does not
write; `aw_save.c` stores each NPC's health only; the QuakeC resident spawn knows no dead state.

## How it happened

The first combat layer was built for the arena test room, whose session is captured and restored,
so saving combat was left for later.

## Why it was not caught

No save format change was wanted for the debug minigame; the gap shows only in normal play.

## Reproduction

Always: punch a resident until it dies, save, load.

## Repair

Not yet. Needs a save record per hostile or dead NPC (record reference, health, fatigue, state) or
the original game's own dead-actor handling; a save format change, so it waits for a maintainer
decision.

## Verification

None yet.

## Prevention

Every new piece of runtime state names its save story in its design note (docs/COMBAT.md, Known
limits, now does).
