## Status: 9 October 2026

Fixed in source on v0.0.33-miniwind-ext before any build used it.

## Symptom

Gate 585 (v0.0.33-miniwind-ext 1120d84): `test_build_cache` found the engine sources
(`engine/aga/src/*`) in the source closure of `prepare_world_scenery.py`, so an engine C edit would
change the fingerprint of every conversion stage and `--reuse-from` would rebuild them all.

## Where

`tools/miniwind.py` `prune`, which imported `chim.frame_map` to record removed maps in the pure
CHIM removal format. Every stage imports `tools/build_parallel.py`, which imports `tools/miniwind.py`;
the CHIM tools read engine sources (`tools/engine_limits.py`), and the fingerprint scan follows
imports inside functions too.

## How it happened

The MiniWind exterior scope work unified the prune receipt with `remove_legacy_areas`
(chim.frame_map) and imported it in the shared MiniWind module.

## Why it was not caught

The focused tests run before the gate did not include `test_build_cache`; the full gate did.

## Reproduction

`build_cache.SourceIndex().closure(tools/prepare_world_scenery.py)` lists `engine/aga/src/` files.

## Repair

`tools/miniwind.py` takes the removal function as a parameter; the image step (`tools/build_aga.py`,
whose closure covers the engine anyway) passes `chim.frame_map.remove_legacy_areas` in.

## Verification

`test_build_cache` `test_real_stage_closures_leave_engine_sources_to_the_engine_and_image` passes;
new `FingerprintTests` in `tests/test_miniwind.py`; full gate.

## Prevention

`FingerprintTests` fails if `tools/miniwind.py` or `tools/build_parallel.py` reach the CHIM tools or
engine files.

Family: Build speed (`build-speed`). Every stage on the shared worker pool; per-stage time and CPU in the build profile. See [families](README.md#families).

- [BUILD-CACHE-ABSOLUTE-PATHS-33](BUILD-CACHE-ABSOLUTE-PATHS-33.md): Stage fingerprints contain absolute paths, so a moved workspace or checkout reuses nothing
- [BUILD-CACHE-CHIM-UNITS-33](BUILD-CACHE-CHIM-UNITS-33.md): The chim stage's fingerprint changes whenever the CHIM unit cache gains units, so the stage is never reused
- [BUILD-CACHE-CLOSURE-WIDE-33](BUILD-CACHE-CLOSURE-WIDE-33.md): Stage fingerprints count every module any imported module could import, so unrelated edits rebuild most stages
- [BUILD-CACHE-NO-CUTOFF-33](BUILD-CACHE-NO-CUTOFF-33.md): A rebuilt stage whose outputs come out unchanged still rebuilds every stage after it

- [BUILD-CACHE-PER-WORKSPACE-33](BUILD-CACHE-PER-WORKSPACE-33.md): Per-file caches live in each build workspace, so a build on a new volume with --reuse-from converts everything again (MiniWind media 1,195 s instead of seconds)

- [BUILD-SCHEDULER-EVEN-SHARE-33](BUILD-SCHEDULER-EVEN-SHARE-33.md): The stage scheduler splits the workers evenly between running stages, so the longest stage gets no more than the shortest (MiniWind media on 1 of 4 workers for 1,195 s)
