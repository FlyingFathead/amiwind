## Status: 9 October 2026

Open. Measured on the CHIM world of a v0.0.33-rc1 development build. Needs an owner decision on where the room comes
from ([CHIM lighting](../chim/LIGHTING.md), "Recommendation").

## Symptom

Balmora's active ring peaks at 6,239,776 bytes against a budget of 6,242,304. Every lighting option that stores light
overflows it:

| Option | Ring overflow |
| --- | --- |
| Terrain lightmaps | 14,688 bytes over |
| Terrain lightmaps + per-placement lightmaps where a light reaches | 44,704 bytes over |
| Per-placement lightmaps everywhere | 286,432 bytes over |

Seyda Neen has 558,384 bytes of headroom.

## Where

The CHIM heap gate (`tools/chim/heap.py`) on the Balmora frame (-3,-2). The lighting figures come from
`tools/chim/lighting.py measure`.

## How it happened

Balmora's ring was fitted to the budget before lighting existed (CHIM-ZONE-RING-THRASH-33,
CHIM-BALMORA-RING-OVER-33). The terrain stores one constant light block per chunk, so light never counted.

## Why it was not caught

Lighting was an open design question; nothing measured its memory until now.

## Reproduction

Always: `tools/chim/lighting.py measure WORLD --sdk SDK --master Morrowind.esm` on a Balmora CHIM world.

## Repair

Owner decision. Room can come from:

- a smaller hysteresis or draw distance in Balmora;
- lighter house models;
- a larger CHIM zone.

Option d (dynamic lights only) needs no room, but it is limited to the nearest few lights.

## Verification

Pending: the heap gate passes on Balmora with the chosen lighting.

## Prevention

The lighting figures join the heap gate. A lit build's chunk records carry their lightmaps, so the gate counts them.
